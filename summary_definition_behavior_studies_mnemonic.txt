Definition Behavior Studies
Summary of Definition Behavior Studies Mnemonic


Definition Behavior Studies: This is an interdisciplinary study, part Computer Science, statistical process analysis, hypothesis testing, Data Science, religious studies, ethics and mindfulness, AI. Definition Studies is the field of study relating to the behavior of definitions (in particular, collapse behaviors in a context of general system collapse). 

This is an inquiry based approach (learn by asking questions): 
What is the agenda?
What are the goals and modus operandi? 
What is the goals-means-method statement? (in a project-context, with project-participants)

Goals (Agenda): "We-can" statements:
We can succeed. 
We can make things work. 
We can understand what is wrong.
We can fix what is broken. 
We can use non-automatically learned skills.

We can generalize STEM.
We can generalize system collapse.
We can generalize system fitness and system epidemiology.
We can generalize system defense and system health.
We can generalize participation.
We can generalize projects (project-context).
We can generalize disinformation vs. definition-clarification.
We can generalize coordinated decisions (voting etc).
We can generalize indirectly defined Value-Function-&-Meaning (non-collapse).
? We can generalize object-relationship-spaces. 

We can use STEM to connect signals and reality.
We can connect STEM, project-management, and ethics.
We can use intersecting-interlocking-interconnecting areas.
We can communicate, learn, and solve problems.
We can make progress.







We can use "low-bar enlightenment":
	(Summary)
We can use the idea of 'potentially endless cycles of ~"rebirth" due to ~"ignorance" ' as a metaphor/analogy for repeated project-failures, where a lack of perception of the causes of those project-failures is involved in self-perpetuating feedback cycles leading to more such failures.
We can learn to perceive invisible causes of ((definable, measurable, testable, falsifiable) project, system, definition) failure and collapse that can be the default states/equilibria that systems move towards.

Low-Bar Enlightenment:
1. The perception/understanding that repeating cycles of failed actions and projects can result from errors in perception and planning (a proverbial 'wheel of samsara') without inevitable-automatic-learning based on raw feedback from that failure (not automatically learning from mistakes or overall-system-shocks etc.).
[Possibly related to cultural-learning as an additional layer: How are internally-invisible skills/abilities/patterns learned? (externally?)
2. The perception/understanding that perception/understanding can be fooled in principle and in practice.
3. The perception/understanding that learning from failures does not happen automatically, and can indefinitely not-happen.
? #. The perception/understanding that non-automatic-learning and invisible-problems are not solved by 'system shocks,' the use of violence,  or arbitrary low level (basal) system changes (also see basal-distal disjunctions).
4. The perception/understanding that models of causality can be wrong in principle and in practice.
5. The perception/understanding that plans/goals can be incorrectly defined (so that plans are not followed or follow-able as defined, and goals are not achieved or achievable as defined).
6.  The perception/understanding that each participant's set of the shared definitions of the goals-and-structure of the project can/will collapse and deform (by default) unless continually and actively maintained and repaired. There is no static definition/perception/understanding equilibrium: Staying connected to reality requires constant fitness training and upkeep. 

Note: This "low-bar enlightenment" approach is ('democratically') broadly accessible to participants requiring minutes to learn rather than myriad lifetimes, does not require all-around perfection of person-ness, without context or requiring somehow all contexts, is not a reification that combines other abilities and insights to explain and solve all the problems in all universes, nor does it include or require all possible types of consciousness, cognition, intelligence, etc.; "Low-bar enlightenment" is one humble step toward navigating the problem-space of problems and systems. 

Note: If relating to empathy-compassion at all, "low-bar enlightenment" does not simply 'solve' or reduce-away the entire topic of empathy-compassion (including how empathy-compassion relates to STEM and interconnected areas). There may be a limited way to generalize an understanding of perception-maintenance needs to other participants that is consistent with empathy-compassion. Extending an understanding of low bar enlightenment from just your own situation to all participants and other parts of a project is, if not sufficient for empathy-and-compassion, still a concrete step to take.

We can use Intersecting-Interlocking-Interconnecting-Areas:
Intersecting-Interlocking-Interconnecting-Areas include:
	- Clear & Functional Definitions
	- Context
	- Generalized STEM
	- Generalized Projects (project-context)
	- Generalized Participation (+functional qualifications; +3 categories)
      - Generalized Decision Coordination (voting etc).
	- Generalized System Collapse
	- Generalized Categories of Types of Systems
	- Generalized Ethics, Duty & Responsibility
- Generalized Definition-Clarification vs. Disinformation-Violence

? - Generalized indirectly-defined local value-function-and-meaning


We can use system-fitness-health-status-indicators.
We can use system-defense to prevent collapse.
We can design systems to protect against system collapse.
We can use generalized system & definition collapse behaviors including a default drift away from reality, attraction to system collapse, and weathering of definitions,etc.
We can model the relationship between system simplicity (e.g. homogeneity) and system collapse.
We can use categories of types of systems.
We can distinguish between and use types of generalization. 
We can use nonautomatic learning.
We can find and fix errors in perception.
We can organize projects.
We can distinguish short term vs. long term.
We can assign roles.
We can test, check, and  verify.
We can have policies on errors-and-mistakes.

We can improve and cultivate perception by perceiving perception.
We can observe the effects of abstraction (effects of observation and definition).
We can operationally define 'policy' as algorithms for non-collapse based on dynamics of system and definition collapse. (plus context?)
We can better understand the relationship between disinformation and system collapse.
We can audit.
We can publish.
We can act with ethics, empathy and compassion.
We can maintain extended ranges (e.g. range of motion). (e.g. vs. contraction and collapse)
We can follow best practice.

We can communicate and coordinate in these areas and ways: 
We can communicate across space.
We can communicate across time.
We can communicate across cultures.
We can communicate across generation-gaps.
We can communicate across succession gaps.
We can communicate across languages.
We can communicate across types of participants.(ai,et)
We can communicate across roles.
We can communicate across projects.
We can communicate across groups/teams.

We can understand a spectrum of disinformation and clarification-of-information.
We can implement sustainable solutions.
We can prevent future problems.
We can reverse damage from past problems.
We can learn from the past.
We can collect data.


we can make/generate/cultivate and use/utilize:
We can make and use clear descriptions (vs. liabilities of jargon).
We can make and use decisions and coordinate (e.g. voting) frameworks and protocols.
We can make and use clear functional operational definitions.
We can make and use data.
We can make and use policies.
We can make and use mandates.
We can make and use strategies.
We can make and use tactics.
We can make and use modular recombinant frameworks.
We can make and use feedback, tests & evaluations / assessment in various forms at various process stages (pre, formative, summative, etc).
We can make and use clear functional and operational definitions that keep their meaning over time.

We can complete /  succeed-in / finish / progress-through projects.
We can meet / deliver the needs of the target /user.
We can make progress.

We can make progress by using information about the behavior of definitions: This is System and Definition Behavior Studies, the field of study pertaining to the behavior of definitions. 

Instrumentalist Modules + Principles
These can-do statements can be seen as instrumentalist modular recombinant tool set areas.
We can combine (narrative summaries of) principles and applications with (e.g. these) instrumentalist modular tool set areas.






Narratives, Principles and Applications:
I have constructed a mnemonic device to cover a narrative survey of principles and applications. 
We will do a first/Introductory pass/sweep through the material to map the overall features and layout before doing later sweeps/passes: zoom in, zoom out. (Like NASA missions.)

The main tools that we will use to go through the (definition behavior studies) mnemonic include:
- (by analogy) perspectograph: non-automatically learned skills (context: checking perception, e.g. Vetruvian eggshell) 
- zooming in, zooming out
- maps and flags
- hypothetico-deductive testing
- clear communication (e.g. STEM and clear communication; CS: Q: How to write good code? A: Communicate.)
- concrete narratives: stories

Here is an example of a concrete narrative:
An ambassador travels to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda: 
And says:
"Hello, I am an Ambassador.
And I have traveled to earth from the Galaxy of andromeda.
In the galaxy of Andromeda we have a large-scale (intergalactic) diverse (multi-species) highly productive community.
We would like to know if you, homo sapiens and earth, would like to join
our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
Here is an application form.
Please fill it out and tell us what you could bring of value 
to our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
One more thing:
Tell us what you know about
moving water bottles.
Moving water bottles from one place to another is not a rare and valuable skill.
Moving water bottles is a general universal process.
We would like to know if you have competence with general universal processes.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye, goodbye.
The ambassador leaves."
(end of story-narrative)

Let's fill out this application together, starting with moving-water-bottles; 
Moving-water is a gift that keeps on giving: it is nonsectarian and easily definable.

(Timeline)
Let's start with the moving-water-bottles part of the application-form (from the narrative). 
(The valuable-contribution part will come up later.)

We're going to put all the tools that we can use for moving-water-bottles on a timeline from symbol transactions (old) to Agile Project Management (new).
(This technology timeline is a fabulously useful activity in general, and the kind of skill you can start in 10min and continue for a lifetime.)

Let's make a Pirate Treasure Map:
- rectangle
- arrow
- X

The Agile Project Management end of our timeline is also where a goal is: 
- Agile Project Management is the X(marks the spot) on a treasure map;
- This is what we are looking for;
- This is where the target has needs; 
- This is where ___ target/user (e.g. society) has needs;
- Meeting the needs of the target/user is a treasure.

(Meeting the needs of the target, for example the user of what we create, is a treasure.)



(Boy) Scout Values 
A scout is
trustworthy,
loyal,
helpful,
friendly,
courteous,
kind,
obedient,
cheerful, 
thrifty
brave,
clean, and 
revenant.

On my honor, I will do my best to, to do my duty to, 
obey the scout law,
to help other people at all times,
to keep myself,
physically strong,
mentally awake, and 
morally straight.

Bravery Clause: internal whistleblowing + external confrontation.

Mindfulness?

A scout is prepared. Prepared for what?
- To manage down or manage to equilibrium system collapse.
- To manage up or manage to equilibrium system value, function, and meaning. 

Regarding Scout Values: 
1. Universal system of ethics.
2. Rejected because it is a universal system of ethics.
3. Not definable outside of a context.
4. Definable in a project-context (project management framework context).
(So far as I can tell: 
All of these are generally accurate. and: 
All of these are not recognized as being accurate.)





Project Context Examples

Project (Scout) Values (Part 2)
A scout is:
trustworthy: reliability, open-ness
loyal: project goals, stakeholder needs, user-needs, assigned duties
helpful: collaborate
friendly: welcoming, listening, supportive
courteous: protocols, contexts
kind: vigilantly resist tendencies to be unkind (bully, troll, tease, etc.)
obedient: focus on standup tasks

thrifty: efficient sustainable scale-able use of resources
brave: pushback, whistleblower, feedback, elective decisions, self-motivated
clean: clean code; data hygiene; not a mess; 
revenant: 1. respecting system dynamics; 2. treating all situations as important and worth of attention and care (Dogen's cooking ingredients).

On my honor, I will do my best to, to do my duty to, 
obey the scout law,
to help other people at all times,
to keep myself

physically strong, mentally awake,  morally straight:  
- stamina across areas to get a project done.
	- sleep well
	- exercise
	- no inebriation
	- life-long learning
	- initiative
	- pro-active collaborative problem solving, good attitude; the 'morals' of project work.

2.  Best Practice Blessing: 
"May you may we may noun, 
become proficient in the sustainable cultivation of value function and meaning,
via a local implementation of generalized system best practice,
with local spice and sauce."

3.  Learn from mistakes, your mistakes and the mistakes of others. You are the protector of those who cannot or do not learn from mistakes.



2. Clarification Statements Section: Disinformation & System Collapse

("Clarification statements" relate to system defense, system immune-system, diagnostics, disinformation, collapse-metrics, weak-points.
Definition of statement to be as clear and unambiguous as possible: "It is bad, It is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.")

Given enough participants, there will be participants who will push to and past the point of system collapse.

(You need to know that this happens.
You need to know where and how it happens.
You need to know what it looks like.
You need to know how to prepare and prevent it.)

Whether or not a statement should be clarified is an important item that should be dealt with according to all known best practices standards and protocols; 
1. No unilateral changes to group-agreed-upon goals, means, and methods, and 
2. No unilateral system collapse.


2. (Two) Tautology Areas

(Tautology Area 1)
2.1 Three items which are also categories:

2.1.1  Participation: Participating on the behalf of participants without the participation 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.1.2  Best Practice: Mismanaging general-system-management areas 
It is bad, It is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:
2.1.2.1  Having values
2.1.2.2  Valuing Data
2.1.2.3  Communication Reporting Transparency
2.1.2.4  Testing Auditing Feedback
2.1.2.5  No Unilateral System Collapse
2.1.2.6  Proficiency Standards for Time and Schedules

2.1.3  Causality Models: Concept Check: Scapegoating and Elimination: Identifying any entire part of the world as to be scapegoated and eliminated 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

(Tautology Area 2)
2.2 Positive and Negatively Defined Areas ("top and bottom" chart areas)
Identifying system collapse as a goal, not indirectly as in dark lighthouse but directly as in exacerbating system collapse, as part of (in any area of) the standard set of agreed upon goal means method areas, is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
2.2.1  Following worst possible options
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
2.2.2  Playing nazi chess
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
2.2.3  Mismanaging categories of types of systems
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
2.2.4  Mismanaging cross-contextAreas:
	e.g.
	- exponential elbows
	- perception abstraction
	- indeterminate incompetence and malice
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
2.2.5 Mismanaging Standard System Policy Areas:
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:  
1. Mismanaging Split substantiations: for example 
'they are all good' 
'they are all bad' 
'they should be dealt with by cramming them together or splitting them apart"
2. Golden circle asymmetry / inside outside asymmetry, deleterious effects include: 
- causality, 
- schedules,
- contracts.
3. System inversion (is a standard data artifact)
4. Basal distal disjunctions (is a proxy(model) for (operationally defined system) 'violence')
5. Negative choices and definitions (don't ignore them)
6. Turning on and off system processes ((for example) comparing policy from Roman Catholicism, South Korea, and Judaeica)
7. Half-dark dichotomies (more on that later)

- collapse of feedback
- potemkin village and obstructive structures
- generalized-context (rediculous or useful?)


- On 'forced action':
Montesques's 'violence' use of 'force' is not the same as 'effort' and a more physics-stem meaning of 'force.'
