Definition Behavior Studies
Summary Definition Behavior Studies Mnemonic

This is an inquiry based approach (learn by asking questions): What is the agenda? What are the goals, and modus operandi? What is the goals-means-method statement?

This is an explanation of an interdisciplinary study, part Computer Science, statistical process analysis, hypothesis testing, Data Science, religious studies, ethics and Mindfulness. Definition Studies is the field of study relating to the behavior of definitions (in particular, collapse behaviors in a context of general system collapse). 

Goals: "We-can" statements:
We can succeed. 
We can make things work. 
We can understand what's wrong.
We can fix what is broken. 
We can use non-automatically lost skills.
We can generalize STEM.
We can generalize system collapse.
We can generalize system fitness and system epidemiology.
We can generalize participation.
We can generalize projects.
We can generalize object-relationship-spaces.
We can use STEM to connect signals and reality.
We can connect STEM project management and ethics.
We can use intersection-interlocking-interconnecting areas.
We can communicate, learn, and solve problems.
We can make progress.

We can use "low-bar enlightenment":
(Taking potentially endless cycles of ~"rebirth" due to ~"ignorance" as a metaphor/analogy for (a set of cases of) repeated project-failure due to a lack of perception of the causes of those project failures, where the group agreed upon goal is completing the project and meeting a user/target need.)
We can learn to perceive what can by default be invisible causes of failure and collapse:
1. The perception that repeating cycles of failed actions and projects can result from errors in perception and planning (a proverbial 'wheel of samsara') without inevitable-automatic-learning based on that failure.
2. The perception that perception can be fooled in principle and in practice.
3. The perception that learning from failures does not happen automatically (and can, under bad circumstances, can indefinitely not-happen).
4. The perception that models of causality can be wrong in principle and in practice.
5. The perception that plans/goals can be incorrectly set (so that they fail to be achieved as set).
6.  The perception that each participant's set of the shared definitions about the goals and structure of the project can/will collapse and deform unless maintained and repaired. 

We can use system-fitness-health-status-indicators
We can generalize system & definition collapse behaviors
We can use categories of types of systems.
We can use nonautomatic learning.
We can find and fix errors in perception.

We can organize projects.
We can use clear descriptions.
We can use decision and coordinating (voting) frameworks and protocols.
We can distinguish short term vs. long term.
We can assign roles.
We can check and verify.
We can have policies on "errors and mistakes."

We can improve and cultivate perception by perceiving perception.
We can prevent future problems.
We can reverse damage from past problems.
We can learn from the past.
We can collect data.
We can make and use policies.
(We can operationally define 'policy' as algorithms for non-collapse based on dynamics of collapse.)
We can make strategies.
We can make tests.
We can make operational definitions.
We can audit.
We can publish.
We can act with ethics, empathy and compassion.
We can follow best practice.

We can communicate: 
We can communicate across space.
We can communicate across time.
We can communicate across cultures.
We can communicate across generation-gaps & succession gaps.
We can communicate across languages.
We can communicate across types of participants.
We can communicate across roles.
We can communicate across projects.
We can communicate across media of communication.

We can understand a spectrum of disinformation and clarification-of-information.
We can implement sustainable solutions.
We can fix what is broken.
We can prevent future problems.
We can reverse damage from past problems.
We can learn from the past.
We can collect data.

We can make/generate/cultivate and use/utilize:
We can make and use data.
We can make and use policies.
We can make and use mandates.
We can make and use strategies.
We can make and use tactics.
We can make and use tests & evaluations.
We can make and use clear functional and operational definitions that keep their meaning over time..

We can complete/succeed-in/finish projects
We can meet(/deliver) the needs of the target(/user).
We can make progress.

We can make progress by using information about the behavior of definitions: This is system and definition behavior studies, the field of study pertaining to the behavior of definitions. 

These can-do statements can be seen as instrumentalist modular tool set areas.
We can add narrative summaries of principles and applications to instrumentalist modular tool set areas.



Narratives, Principles and Applications:

I have constructed a mnemonic device to cover a narrative survey of principles and applications. 
The main tools that we will use to go through the mnemonic include:

- (by analogy) perspectograph: non automatically learned skills (context: checking perception, e.g. Vetruvian eggshell) Questions: how do we know if what we are seeing is accurate
- zooming in, zooming out, 
- maps and flags:
- hypothetico-deductive testing,
- clear communication (e.g. STEM and clear communication: Q: How to write good code? A: Communicate.)
- concrete narratives: stories



Here is an example of a concrete narrative:
An ambassador travels to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda: 
And says:
"Hello, I am an Ambassador.
And I have traveled to earth from the Galaxy of andromeda.
In the galaxy of Andromeda we have a large-scale (intergalactic) diverse (multi-species) highly productive community.
We would like to know if you, homo sapiens and earth, would like to join
our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
Here is an application form.
Please fill it out and tell us what you could bring of value 
to our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
One more thing:
tell us what you know about
moving water bottles.
Moving water bottles from one place to another is not a rare and valuable skill.
It (moving water bottles) is a general universal process.
We would like to know if you have competence with general universal processes.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye, goodbye.
The ambassador leaves."
(end of story-narrative)

Let's fill out this application together, 
starting with moving-water-bottles; 
The (moving) water is a gift that keeps on giving: it is nonsectarian and easily definable.

(Timeline)
Let's start with the timeline part of the application. (The valuable-contribution part will come up later.)
We're going to put all the tools that we can use for moving-water-bottles on a timeline from symbol transactions (old) to Agile Project Management (new).
(This technology timeline is a fabulous activity, the kind of skill you can start in 10min and continue for a lifetime.)

Pirate treasure map:
rectangle, arrow, X. 
The Agile Project Management end of our timeline is also where a goal is: 
Agile is the X marks the spot on a treasure map; this is what we are looking for; this is where the target has needs. 
This is where society has needs.
Meeting the needs of the target, for example the user of what we create, is a treasure.
Meeting the needs of the target is a treasure.
Meeting the needs of the user is a treasure.

Anyone you are helping with a project can be a target.





(Boy) Scout Values ( Perhaps just 'Person Scouts' now?)
A scout is
trustworthy
loyal
helpful
friendly
courteous
kind
obedient
cheerful 
thrifty
brave
clean
revenant

on my honor, I will do my best to, to do my duty to, 
obey the scout law
to HELP OTHER PEOPLE AT ALL TIMES
to keep myself
physically strong
mentally awake, and 
morally straight.

Bravery Clause: internal whistleblowing + external confrontation.

A scout is prepared. Prepared for what?
- To manage down or manage to equilibrium system collapse.
- To manage up or manage to equilibrium system value, function, and meaning. 

Regarding Scout Values: (so far as I can tell, all of these are generally accurate or true, and all of these are generally not officially recognized as being accurate or true.)
1. universal system of ethics
2. rejected because it is a universal system of ethics
3. not definable outside of a context
4. definable in a project-management context






(end of introduction to Mnemonic)

Mnemonic Template:
Four sections:
1 - Value Statements
2 - Clarification Statements (for contracts)
3 - Standard Error and Damage Report (in four subsections)
4 - Macro-Model

(beginning of Mnemonic)


Target ______ . (e.g. Homo sapiens and Earth)
Hello, my name is ___ I was born in ___, my current residence is _____.

This should be generalizable and specifically applicable given a 5x5 participation array:

(Note: 1. Value Statements Section, operational definition of 'help')

Four  addendum items:
1. Setting Location Items:
The water the wind the world,
best practice,
and other,
standards,
elements,
protocols,
gestalts,
symbols, signs,
portals pathways,
world-as-unit items and translatable(s),
fractal landscape items,
phases of matter,
phase transitions,
directions, dimensions, (cardinal et al),
post-participants,
linear time,
nonlinear time.

Q: Why are we talking about setting location areas? 
A: 
ideal chess boards
Definitions of insanity: 
you have local factors, 
other people have different local factors, 
you need policies to cover all these areas.

2. Love, act responsibly towards, fulfill duty towards,
 including a framework borrowed from biology containing comensal
including: 
1. energy, 
2. nutrients, 
3. Shannon/TuringInformation, 
4. Definition behaviors, (probably negatively defined e.g. collapse behaviors)

Q: Why are we talking about ethics (love duty and responsibility)? 
A: There is an epidemic of anti-best practice action and rhetoric, there should be:
1. system medicine research area;
2. system epidemiology task-force.


3. Reception And Reflection:
There is a time for reception and reflection.
I will be receptive and reflective for a [period of] time 
for example 3-5 inhalation-exhalation cycles,
(e.g.)
1 meter squared
1 meter diameter
+
three levels of duty (pre-participant, participant, post-participant) + participation-modes

4. 
range of motion
non-transference (non-automatic learning, non-general learning)
(policies on) errors and mistakes
vetruvian-egg-shell
empathy and compassion

7. professional technical production advice: six sigma for rivers, grains of sand, ecosystems, keystone species

8. Number 8 (a kind of separate branch-area: )
1.  Help others at all times: I will do my best to help all parties according to all known best practice standards and protocols to manage up or manage to equilibrium system value function and meaning, to manage down or manage to equilibrium system collapse.
2.  Best Practice Blessing: 
"May you may we may noun, 
become proficient in the sustainable cultivation of value function and meaning,
via a local implementation of generalized system best practice,
with local spice and sauce."
3.  Learn from mistakes, your mistakes and the mistakes of others. You are the protector of those who cannot or do not learn from mistakes.







2. Clarification Statements Section: Disinformation & System Collapse

("clarification statements" relate to system defense, system immune-system, diagnostics, disinformation, collapse-metrics, weak-points
Definition node: "It is bad, It is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.")


Given enough participants, there will be participants who will push to and past the point of system collapse.

(You need to know that this happens.
You need to know where and how it happens.
You need to know what it looks like.
You need to know how to prepare and prevent it.)

Whether or not a statement should be clarified is an important item that should be dealt with according to all known best practices standards and protocols. No unilateral changes to group agreed upon goals, means and methods, and no unilateral system collapse.


Two Tautology Areas:
2.1 Three items which are also (Three) categories:
"2.1.1 Participation: participating on the behalf of participants without the participation 
is bad, it's wrong, it should not be done, and I will not do it."
"2.1.2 Best practice: mismanaging general-system-management areas 
is bad, it's wrong, it should not be done, and I will not do it."
"2.1.3 Causality models: Concept-check: scapegoating and elimination: Identifying any entire part of the world as to be scapegoated and eliminated 
is bad, it's wrong, it should not be done and I will not do it."

2.2 Positive and negatively defined areas ("top and bottom" chart areas)
Identifying system collapse as a goal, not indirectly as in dark lighthouse but directly as in exacerbating system collapse, as part of any area of the standard set of agreed upon goal means method areas, is bad, wrong, causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it. 

2.2.1  following worst possible options
2.2.2  playing nazi chess
2.2.3  mismanaging categories of types of systems
2.2.4  mismanaging Standard System Policy Areas:
for example:  
1. Mismanaging Split substantiations: for example 
'they are all good' 
'they are all bad' 
'they should be dealt with by cramming them together or splitting them apart"
2. golden circle inside outside asymmetry, deleterious effects include: causality schedules contracts
3. system inversion is a standard data artifact
4. basal distal disjunctions: is a proxy(model) for (operationally defined system) 'violence'.
5. negative choices and definitions: don't ignore them
6. turning on and off system processes: (for example) comparing policy from roman catholicism, south Korea and Judaeica
7. half dark dichotomies: more on that later
