,,,,,,,,,
,I have constructed a mnemonic device to cover a narative survey of principles and applications. ,,,,,,,,
,the main tools that we will use to go through the mnemonic include: by analogy,,,,,,,,

,clear communication (e.g. STEM and clear communication: how to write good code: communicate,,,,,,,,

,"Doing this survey project we will use these tools: by analogy or literally: the perspectigraph, air travel to zoom in and out, hypothecio deductive testing, concrete naratives: ",,,,,,,,
,Concrete naratives are extremely important for technical areas. ,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,

,We will start (with an instroduction) by looking at use-cases and example problems where definition studies should measurably succeed or fail to solve the problem. ,,,,,,,,
,"We will look at four case study example problems: 
1. The ""use of best practice tools"" problem: prediction and auditing,
2. the ""survival of mind"" problem as project selection criteria prediction and auditing,
3. Desecrimination (as in racial descrimination and bigotry)
4. Radicalization & Extreamism, Pro Collapse and Anti-Value-Function-and-meaning",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,"You can look at definition studies, or the mnemonic tool set, as the same kind of tool as the historical Perspectograph tool for aiding, training-teaching non-automatic perception.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,"And there is a hypothetical scenareo, a story, to give a user friendly context and frame of refernce to start with.
The story goes like this:
An embasador travels to earth from the Galaxy of Andromeda, and says: ""Hello, I am an Embasador, and I have traveled to Earth from the Galaxy of Andromeda. In the Galaxy of Adnramada"", the Embasador says, ""We have a large scale, intergalactic, diverse, multi-species, highly productive community. We would like to know if you, Homo sapiens and Earth, would like to join our diverse, multi-species, large scale, intergalactic, highly productive communiyt. Here is an application form. Please tell us what you could bring of value to our large scale, intergalactic, diverse, multi-species, highly productive community. And one more thing: please tell us what you know about moving water bottles. Moving water bottles from one place to another is not a rare and valuable skill, it is a general more universal process. We want to know if you have or lack basic competance with general universal processses. Thank you very much. Good bye. Goodbye."" And the Embasador leaves. ",,,,,,,,

,Context Intro:,,,,,,,,
,"Q: What has science yet to discover?
Over the history and evolution of the sciences up to the present time, our sophistication in modeling processes has ebbed and flowed and generally progressed. One of the more recent areas, which I will argue is relevent to science, is the use of ~statistical analysis relating to processes, for example: Has X process occured or has X been done? This is unquestionably part of science when the X-process in quetsion is (or is part of) a physics experiment at a university. But what happens when perhaps the same exact process happens in a company, in manufacturing, or in a municiple facility (say water treatment), or a hopsital (say the steps to disinfect medical equipement), or in a school (note: arguably Universties are schools), or regarding software and or hardward development in any of those sectors. Science should be sector agnostic, though culturally in the west we are often shy about extending the rigors of science to buisness,  
",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,"While we like to think that nothing has really changed about the scientific method since oh, arm waving, maybe descartes, more arm waving, and we try to change the subject, but actually at lot has happened in the practical evolution of our understanding of, for example, statistical signficance and experimental results since the French Enlightenment (much happening in the later half of the 1900s, even the now standard 'falify the nul hypothsis' system seems to have not been established in consensus until Karl Popper). And buisnesses started trying their own statisical standardization, irocially earlier than science established it's own (e..g in the 1920's). And today there is the predictably dificult to discuss area of a science of SCRUM project management and the existence or not of ""Agile Mindset"" topics.",,,,,,,,
," And that very topic, looking scientifically at the 'Agile Mindset' is exactly where I want to start to help you frame the context for why and how I have documented a rigrous, operationally defined, system for using the behaviors of defintions to plot out and measure a dynamical space which I think we can all agree is very directly relevant to getting work done. Whether I have been successful is for me a secondary issue, I primarily want to focus disucssion on the importance of this area, with confidense that with the right guiding quetsions someone will get the models working corretly.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,
,Four Important Notes on Scout Values,,,,,,,,
,"1. Scout Values are very close to being a universal set of moral-ethica-values, which is not recognized and which are near-universally NOT acknowledge to even be possible.",,,,,,,,
,"2. Scout Values are rejected because they effectively represent positive values,  which is not recognized and which are near-universally NOT acknowledge to even be possible.",,,,,,,,
,"3. Scout Values are very difficult to define or even understand abstractly outside of any context, which is not recognized and which are near-universally NOT acknowledge to even be possible (e.g. 'a rotational element') (note, with the occational exeption of 'clean')",,,,,,,,
,"4. Scout Values are very easy to understand (define?) within a specific context, especially SCRUM (which is the topic focus here, which is not recognized and which are near-universally NOT acknowledge to even be possible.",,,,,,,,

,elements,,,,,,,,
,protocols,,,,,,,,
,gestalts,,,"gestalt' is a kind of key word in this section: which also highlights the interplay between figure and ground. In a sense this areas is ""figures of the ground"" or elemental gestalts of the setting and context. For example in a buisness context, an extremely ephemeral yet legally signficant fuzzy gestalt is ""race"" (as in ethnicity-race, not sports horse races). Even though it has been about a century since there was any scientific entertainment of the existence of 'race,' the gestalt of race is present, important, and must be dealt with employing nuance, tact and vigilence. E.g. destructive preduce rarely manifests itself by a close study of reality, and defending against hate-crimes (including guarding against committing such internally) involves a facility with fictions.
