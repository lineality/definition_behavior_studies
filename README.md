Overview of A Definition Behavior Studies Mnemonic
 2023.12.24-31

Warmup Brainstorm 1: concepts of improvement
- naive positivism
- equilibria
- system collapse
- positive and negative definition
- cycles longevity, sequence


Definition Behavior Studies is an interdisciplinary area of study, part Computer Science, statistical process analysis, hypothesis testing, Data Science, religious studies, ethics and mindfulness, and AI.

System and definition behavior studies is the field of study pertaining to the behavior of definitions, in particular collapse behaviors in a context of general system collapse. 

This is an inquiry based approach where we learn by asking questions and where we ask the difficult questions. 
What is the agenda?
What are the goals and modus operandi? 
What is the goals-means-method statement (in a project-context, with project-participants)?


Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 1 
What is your agenda?

Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 2
What are other agendas around studying definition behaviors?
- instructor's/text's agenda
- peer's agendas
- organization's, institution's, culture's agendas
- open and transparent agendas
- conscious agendas
- historical agendas, future agendas, present agendas
- misprision and agendas ('to guide')
- improvement and collapse of agendas
- J.M.Keynes on [misunderstanding one's own] Agendas
- other categories you can add

(The following can be a template for a group-agreed-upon-goal-means-methods-statement, a checklist pending what people agree to.)

Goals (Agenda): goals-means-method statement / "we-can" statements:
We can succeed.

We Can Use "Low-Bar Enlightenment":
	(Summary)
We can use the idea of 'being trapped in potentially endless cycles of ~"rebirth" due to ~"ignorance" ' as a metaphor/analogy/simile/paradigmatic-model/example for repeated project-failures, where a lack of perception / understanding of the causes of project-failure is involved in self-perpetuating feedback cycles leading to such repeating failures (with invisible or misunderstood causes): 
The goal is ending cycles of being endlessly-'reborn' into mismanaged-projects that unnecessarily-fail in the same correctable, but uncorrected, ways over and over again.
We can learn to perceive invisible (or previously unperceived and / or not-automatically-perceived) causes of failure and collapse ((definable, measurable, testable, falsifiable) project, system, definition failure and collapse), where this failure and collapse (this system-state of failure-collapse) can be the default state(s)/equilibrium(ia) that systems move and iterate towards.
We can stop these cycles of failure by using information/data, perception, and learning.


Low-Bar Enlightenment (elements of):
1. The perception/understanding that repeating cycles of failed actions and projects can result from errors in perception and planning (a proverbial 'wheel of samsara').
2. The perception/understanding that indefinately-repeating cycles-of-failed actions and projects can exist without inevitable-automatic-learning arising from raw feedback of experiential data about that failure. 
I.e., learning (that is sufficient to prevent the problem in future) does not automatically result from experiencing mistakes or overall-system-shocks, etc.
[Possibly related to ~'cultural/epiphenomena'-learning as an additional layer:  Q: How are "internally"-invisible skills/abilities/patterns learned? A: "Externally"?]
3. The perception/understanding that perception/understanding can be fooled in principle and in practice.
4. The perception/understanding that learning-from-failures does not happen automatically, and can indefinitely not-happen.
5. The perception/understanding that learning-from-failures does not transfer automatically from one perceived-recognized-learned area to other areas, and can indefinitely not-transfer.
6. The perception/understanding that non-automatic-learning and invisible-problems are not solved by 'system shocks,' the use of violence, or arbitrary low level (basal) system changes (also see basal-distal disjunctions).
7. The perception/understanding that models of causality can be wrong in principle and in practice.
8. The perception/understanding that plans/goals can be incorrectly defined (so that plans are not followed or follow-able as defined, and goals are not achieved or achievable as defined).
9.  The perception/understanding that each participant's set of the shared definitions of the goals-and-structure-of-a-project can/will erode, weather, corrode, contract, deform and collapse (by default) unless properly configured and continually and actively maintained and repaired. There is no static definition/perception/understanding equilibrium: Staying connected to reality requires constant fitness-training, data-hygiene, and upkeep. 
(Universality Question: specific biology[intelligence] vs. general[ai, etc]?)
10.  The perception/understanding that there are different types of non-automatic learning.
11.  The perception/understanding that low-bar-enlightenment-perception applies to and extends to all parts of and participants in a project (and connected-projects) including time, not just you (being) here now. (~system-empathy/~system-compassion)
12. Broad Accessibility: The perception/understanding that useful learning can occur without many other dependencies (and is therefore broadly, generally, accessible to participants).
13. That the relationship between data, perception, learning, decisions, actions, and coordination, is not always simple, linear, or automatic.


Detail Notes
Note: This "low-bar enlightenment" approach is ('democratically') broadly accessible to participants requiring minutes to learn rather than myriad lifetimes, does not require all-around perfection of person-ness, is not without context or does not require (somehow) all contexts, is not a reification that combines other abilities and insights to explain and solve all problems in all universes, nor does it include or require all possible types of consciousness, cognition, intelligence, etc.; "Low-bar enlightenment" is one humble step toward navigating the problem-space of problems and systems. 

Note: There may be a limited way to generalize an understanding of perception-maintenance needs ( 'low bar enlightenment' ) to other participants in a way that is consistent with empathy-compassion. Extending an understanding of low bar enlightenment from only your own situation (perceptions, roles, projects, etc.) to being something that applies in a larger space (in which one participates with other participants) to all participants and all other parts of any and all projects (e.g. definitions, signals, perceptions, function-operations, participants, schedules, etc.)(including the effects and spread of system-failure between parts and between participants, between projects, etc.) is, if not sufficient for empathy-and-compassion in a broader or deeper sense, a consistent and concrete step to take towards acting with, or that is consistent-with acting-with, (action, behavior with) empathy-and-compassion, including an understanding of how empathy-compassion relates to STEM and interconnected-intersecting-interlocking areas.

Note: 'Reality' (the meaning used here) is not a single, simple, uniform, static, homogeneous, linear, thing made of only one type of system assumed to fit into a single framework. (e.g. not naive realist positivist) 

Note: Low-bar enlightenment and or definition behavior studies may contradict the description or definition of anything information-related as being tautologically "anti-entropic." E.g. perhaps as a kind of higher-level-noise that ends up reducing signals in a system to the same predictable low-entropy noise. . [You might use the same overall case study of telephone messages traveling from an east coast to a west coast without being altered, degraded, collapsed, noise-ified, lost, etc. Note: Using a moving-water-bottles-logistics project example, the collapse of definitions need not refer to any fuzzy higher-order cultural concepts, with no need to wave arms about 'moot cultural meanings'; low level metric, spec and instruction signal integrity can be the focus. (Another possible analogy-overlap: social-engineering attacks used on purely automated systems.)]

Note: There are many different kinds of non-automatic learning, or many ways that outcomes can be 'invisible,' from elusive past-future connections and non-obvious casual connections, to literally invisible events like radiation, to non-automatic skills such as literacy, to specific biases in a particular system (optical illusions, super-signals etc), to unclear sets of correlations (some of which are incidental), to sometimes confusing system spaces such as indeterminacy(incompetence and malice perhaps) and exponential-elbows(fractal static sometimes and dynamic changing sometimes). And more overtly there is opposition to recognizing the basic concepts themselves: the existence of the phenomena of non-automatic learning, of failures or imperfections in perception, of the existence of basic parts of an agile project, of both the importance of project management and risk of bad planning, the long history of psychological and social barriers to specific and general STEM concepts (including connecting areas of STEM (including by STEM professionals)), etc., even the general issue of not being able to easily see your own biases (or assumptions and context, fish-in-water, hammer-and-nails). Input-output measure may be a helpful tool.

Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 3:
What factors may affect and shape agendas? How might agendas change or drift over time? How do agendas relate to group agreed upon project goals?
Review and comment on activities 1,2

Instrumentalist Modules + Principles, Applications, Narratives
These can-do statements (the goals and agenda for definition behavior studies) can be seen as instrumentalist, modular, recombinant, tool-set areas. We can combine (narrative summaries of) principles and applications with instrumentalist, modular, tool set areas.



Narratives, Principles and Applications:
A mnemonic device can be constructed to cover a narrative survey of principles and applications. One can start with a first introductory pass/sweep through the material in order to map the overall features and layout before doing subsequent sweeps and passes. Using this method of zooming in and zooming out, an increasingly broad and deep model can be constructed and understood. By analogy this approach may be seen as emulating NASA missions that gradually increase in breadth and depth mapping the outside world.


The main tools that we will use to go through the System and Definition Behavior Studies mnemonic include:
1. Examining Perception
2. Tests, especially hypothetico-deductive testing, or hypothesis testing
3. Clear communication
4. Concrete narratives, or stories

Here is an example of a concrete narrative:
An ambassador travels to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda: 
And says:
"Hello, I am an Ambassador.
And I have traveled to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda.
In the galaxy of Andromeda we have a large-scale (intergalactic) diverse (multi-species) highly productive community.
We would like to know if you, homo sapiens and earth, would like to join
our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
Here is an application form.
Please fill it out and tell us what you could bring of value 
to our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
One more thing: Tell us what you know about moving water bottles.
Moving water bottles from one place to another is not a rare and valuable skill.
Moving water bottles is a general universal process.
We would like to know if you have competence with general universal processes.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye, goodbye.
The ambassador leaves."
(end of story-narrative)

Active Learning Project-Assignment 4
Fill out this application, starting with moving-water-bottles. 


Let's start with the moving-water-bottles part of the application-form (from the narrative). 
(The valuable-contribution part will come up later.)

Water (as in the case example of moving water( containers)) is a gift that keeps on giving: it is nonsectarian and it is easily definable.

[The location of the water at a given time is concrete but the processes challenge our assumptions and require better models and participant coordination.]

Gifts that Keep on Giving:
- Timelines are a gift that keeps on giving.
- Moving water is a gift that keeps on giving.
- Meeting the needs of the user/society is a gift that keeps on giving.

Active Learning Project-Assignment 5: Timeline
Following the story in the sample narrative, we are going to make a timeline. We are going to put all the tools that we can use for moving-water-bottles on a timeline from the oldest known tools such as symbol transactions to the newest tools such as Agile Project Management.

Note: Making a 'technology timeline' is a fabulously useful activity in general, and the kind of skill you can start in 10min and continue for a lifetime.

The end of our timeline (where 'Agile Project Management' is) is also where a goal is. If overly simplistic, we can represent this as a classic (pirate) treasure map:
- rectangle
- arrow
- X

And to further clarify, if overly simplistic: 
- Agile Project Management is the X-marks the spot goal-target on a treasure map;
- This goal-target is what we are looking for;
- This goal is where the agile-user (another target) has needs; 
- This is where ___ target-user (of your project, in this example: all of humanity and society) has needs;
- Meeting the needs of your target-user is a treasure.



 

Boy Scout Values (slightly modified)
A scout is
- trustworthy,
- loyal,
- helpful,
- friendly,
- courteous
- kind,
- obedient,
- cheerful, 
- thrifty
- brave,
- clean, and 
- reverent.

On my honor, I will do my best to, to do my duty to, to guide projects:
- obey the scout law,
- to help other people at all times,
- to keep myself,
- physically strong,
- mentally awake, and 
- morally straight.

Bravery Clause (from Order of The Arrow): internal whistleblowing + external confrontation.

Guidance clause: Duty, Responsibility and Setting-location-items, ancestors, spirituality, and religiosity.
[The attempt here is to generalize the overly specific nationalist and theocratic section of the boy scout code to a more general and scale-flexible context that covers the pragmatic and affirmative topics of community, world, ethical principles, etc. This may dovetail with the Drake-Equation Vessel-Functions that can be concretely described in terms of cross-community disaster relief and disturbance regime management.]

A scout is prepared. Prepared for what?
- To manage down or manage to equilibrium system collapse.
- To manage up or manage to equilibrium system value, function, and meaning. 

Regarding Scout Values: 
1. Universal system of ethics.
2. Rejected because it is a universal system of ethics.
3. Not definable outside of a context.
4. Definable in a project-context (project management framework context).
(So far as I can determine, for the above four items regarding scout values: all four are generally accurate in reality and at the same time all four are not recognized by society as being accurate.)



Active Learning Project-Assignment 6: Give an Agile project-context example for each Boy Scout oath and law area. e.g. Descriptions that highlight the difference between: 
1. projects that succeeded and projects that failed
2. teams that you would choose to work with again, vs. not

Active Learning Project-Assignment 7:
Try to describe and define Boy Scout values without using any context, situations, or examples. 

Active Learning Project-Assignment 8:
Compare the with-context and without-context results and experiences.

(end of introduction to mnemonic)
(Beginning of Definition Studies Mnemonic Proper)


Active Learning Project-Assignment 9: 
Pick a target and fill out the Mnemonic template. Your target project should include a user or group of users, and something you are aiding those participants with. (See, agile 'user stories')

Mnemonic

The Target is ______ . (e.g. Homo sapiens and Earth, definition behavior studies.)
Hello, my name is ___, the current project location _____ (time, place).

Four Sections:
1.  Value Statements
1.1  Addendum Items
1.2  Participation Array
1.3  Areas of Interaction
2.  Clarification Statements (for contracts)
3.  Standard Error and Damage Report (in four subsections)
4.  Macro-Model




1. Value Statements Section

This project/framework should be generalizable and specifically applicable given an array of 5x5 items:

(Note: 1. Value Statements Section, operational definition of 'help')


Four Addendum Items:

1.1  Setting Location Items:
The water, the wind, the world, best practice, and other:
standards,
elements,
protocols,
gestalts,

pathways,
world-as-unit items and translatable(s),
fractal landscape items,
phases of matter,
phase transitions,
directions, dimensions, (cardinal et al),
post-participants,
linear time,
nonlinear time

Q: Why are we talking about setting-location-items? 
A: 
- Ideal chess boards
- Definitions of insanity
- You have local factors. 
- Other people have different local factors.
- You need policies to cover all these areas.

e.g. The classic example of two internationally distant sister-cities communicating and coordinating about "natural disaster" relief (flood, storm, quake, etc.) and disturbance regimes (modeling/policy/management.) 


2. Love, Act Responsibly Towards, Fulfill Duties Towards
including a framework borrowed from biology containing "comensal",
including:
1. Energy, 
2. Nutrients, 
3. Shannon/Turing Information, 
4. Definition behaviors

Q: Why are we talking about ethics (love, duty, and responsibility)? 
A: There is an epidemic of anti-best-practice action and rhetoric. There should be:
1. a system medicine research area;
2. a system epidemiology task-force.


3. Reception And Reflection:
There is a time for reception and reflection.
I will be receptive and reflective for a [period of] time 
for example 3-5 inhalation-exhalation cycles,
(e.g.)
1 meter squared
1 meter diameter
+/ 
Three ~levels/areas of duty / participation-modes: pre-participant, participant, post-participant


4. Misc:
- Range of Motion
- non-transference (non-automatic learning, non-general learning)
- (policies on) errors and mistakes

1. (Participant Diversity) Love, Duty, Responsibility, Including Boundary Dissolution Areas
Connection, disconnection, and ambiguity, in the following areas:
1.1 time space location
1.2 perception
1.3 action
1.4 experience
1.5 votes on goals means methods


(2&3)
Operational Definition of "Help":
"Deploying features that meet the stated and indicated needs and goals of a user is 'helping.' "

2. Giving Help
3. Receiving Help
Operational Definition of "Help":
'Help' is defined as deploying a feature that meets the stated, and indicated, needs and goals of a user.


4. Drake Equation Vessel Functions: in the following seven areas
Sub-Participants can, should, will, want to, do, help, and / or help with, serve, and / or serve with, setting-location-items in a legal vessel-capacity occupational role and niche and offer legal-vessel-contracts in the following ~seven areas:

4.1  Sensory Motor (Lear: Use My Eyes) Areas (Plus Electromagnetism)
4.2  Benzaiten Saraswati Areas (Plus historical continuity, minus high definition input output data-literacy/numeracy) (Note: translation and transmission)
?4.3  Embodyment / Channeling Items: theater-groups and community interaction, CRV, active-imagination
4.4  Functions and Operations:
4.4.1 Null, Void
4.4.1.1 negative choices and definitions
4.4.1.2 consciousness array: 3 fractal vectors
4.4.1.2.1  time, body
4.4.1.2.2  object location event
4.4.1.2.3  behaviors, policies 
4.4.1.2.3.1 behaviors details: 
in / out;  
on / off; 
start / stop; 
begin / end;

mundane / non-mundane
4.4.1.2.3.2 Policies details: 
perception, translation, coordination, collaboration, non-discrimination, non-collapse

4.4.3 Something-hard, Something-Soft Areas
4.4.4 (basal) Input-Output Processing Areas
4.4.5 Cross Context Areas

5. Definition Dark Areas / off the one-tree

6. World Dancing, World Singing: the song and dance of compromise

7. Professional Technical Production Advice: six sigma for rivers, grains of sand, ecosystems, keystone species

8. "Help others at all times":

1.  I will do my best to help all parties according to all known best practice standards and protocols; to manage down or manage to equilibrium system-collapse, to manage up or manage to equilibrium system-value-function-and-meaning.

2.  Best Practice Blessing: 
"May you, may we, may noun, 
become proficient 
in the sustainable cultivation 
of value, function, and meaning,
via a local implementation 
of generalized system best practice,
with local spice and sauce."
[~'...with local customs and knowledge.']

3.  Learn from mistakes, your mistakes and the mistakes of others. You are the protector of those who cannot or do not learn from mistakes.



2. Clarification Statements Section: 
Disinformation & System Collapse

("Clarification statements" relate to system defense, system immune-system, diagnostics, disinformation, collapse-metrics, weak-points.
Definition of statement to be as clear and unambiguous as possible: "It is bad, it is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.")

Given enough participants, there will be participants who will push to and past the point of system collapse.

(You need to know that collapse happens.
You need to know where and how collapse happens.
You need to know what collapse looks like.
You need to know how to prepare for, prevent, and recover from collapse.)

Whether or not a statement should be clarified is an important item that should be dealt with according to all known best practice standards and protocols; 
1. No unilateral changes to group-agreed-upon goals, means, and methods, and 
2. No unilateral system collapse.


2.  Two Tautology Areas

(Tautology Area 1)
2.1 Tautology Area 1: Three items which are also categories:

2.1.1  Participation: Participating on the behalf of participants without the participation 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.1.2  Best Practice: Mismanaging general-system-management areas 
It is bad, It is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:
2.1.2.1  Having values
2.1.2.2  Valuing Data
2.1.2.3  Communication Reporting Transparency
2.1.2.4  Testing Auditing Feedback
2.1.2.5  No Unilateral System Collapse
2.1.2.6  Proficiency Standards for Time and Schedules

2.1.3  Causality Models: Concept Check: Scapegoating and Elimination: Identifying any entire part of the world as to be scapegoated and eliminated 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

(Tautology Area 2)
2.2 Tautology Area 2: Positive and Negatively Defined Areas ("top and bottom" chart areas)
Identifying system collapse as a goal, not indirectly as in dark lighthouse but directly as in exacerbating system collapse, as part of (defining / in any area of) the standard set of agreed upon goal means method areas, is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it: e.g.

2.2.1  Following worst-possible-options
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.2  Playing nazi-chess
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.3  Mismanaging categories of types of systems
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.4  Mismanaging Cross-Context-Areas:

Summary Brainstorm 1: concepts of improvement
- naive positivism
- equilibria
- system collapse
- positive and negative definition
- cycles longevity, sequence

Summary Brainstorm 2: STEM
What is the nature of how parts of projects and STEM are (or are not) connected? What are categories of types of systems? How do systems, processes, projects, and definitions fail and collapse? Is there any interface between discussion of ethics, morals, even compassion and mindfulness, and the realm of systems and projects and STEM? What are mistakes? What does it mean to learn or course-correct based on mistakes? Can problem-with-perception be themselves perceived? Can obstacles to learning be overcome by learning about those obstacles? 

Summary Brainstorm 3: Clear & Testable Definitions
- What definitions are not sufficiently clear or testable?

Definition Behavior Studies is an interdisciplinary area of study, part Computer Science, statistical process analysis, hypothesis testing, Data Science, religious studies, ethics and mindfulness, and AI.

System and definition behavior studies is the field of study pertaining to the behavior of definitions, in particular collapse behaviors in a context of general system collapse. 

This is an inquiry based approach where we learn by asking questions and where we ask the difficult questions. 
What is the agenda?
What are the goals and modus operandi? 
What is the goals-means-method statement (in a project-context, with project-participants)?

We Can Use "Low-Bar Enlightenment":
	(Summary)
We can use the idea of 'being trapped in potentially endless cycles of ~"rebirth" due to ~"ignorance" ' as a metaphor/analogy/simile/paradigmatic-model/example for repeated project-failures, where a lack of perception / understanding of the causes of project-failure is involved in self-perpetuating feedback cycles leading to such repeating failures (with invisible or misunderstood causes): 
The goal is ending cycles of being endlessly-'reborn' into mismanaged-projects that unnecessarily-fail in the same correctable, but uncorrected, ways over and over again.
We can learn to perceive invisible (or previously unperceived and / or not-automatically-perceived) causes of failure and collapse ((definable, measurable, testable, falsifiable) project, system, definition failure and collapse), where this failure and collapse (this system-state of failure-collapse) can be the default state(s)/equilibrium(ia) that systems move and iterate towards.
We can stop these cycles of failure by using information/data, perception, and learning.


Low-Bar Enlightenment (elements of):
1. The perception/understanding that repeating cycles of failed actions and projects can result from errors in perception and planning (a proverbial 'wheel of samsara').
2. The perception/understanding that indefinately-repeating cycles-of-failed actions and projects can exist without inevitable-automatic-learning arising from raw feedback of experiential data about that failure. 
I.e., learning (that is sufficient to prevent the problem in future) does not automatically result from experiencing mistakes or overall-system-shocks, etc.
[Possibly related to ~'cultural/epiphenomena'-learning as an additional layer:  Q: How are "internally"-invisible skills/abilities/patterns learned? A: "Externally"?]
3. The perception/understanding that perception/understanding can be fooled in principle and in practice.
4. The perception/understanding that learning-from-failures does not happen automatically, and can indefinitely not-happen.
5. The perception/understanding that learning-from-failures does transfer automatically from one perceived-recognized-learned area to other areas, and can indefinitely not-transfer.
6. The perception/understanding that non-automatic-learning and invisible-problems are not solved by 'system shocks,' the use of violence, or arbitrary low level (basal) system changes (also see basal-distal disjunctions).
7. The perception/understanding that models of causality can be wrong in principle and in practice.
8. The perception/understanding that plans/goals can be incorrectly defined (so that plans are not followed or follow-able as defined, and goals are not achieved or achievable as defined).
9.  The perception/understanding that each participant's set of the shared definitions of the goals-and-structure-of-a-project can/will erode, weather, corrode, contract, deform and collapse (by default) unless properly configured and continually and actively maintained and repaired. There is no static definition/perception/understanding equilibrium: Staying connected to reality requires constant fitness-training, data-hygiene, and upkeep. 
(Universality Question: specific biology[intelligence] vs. general[ai, etc]?)
10.  The perception/understanding that there are different types of non-automatic learning.
11.  The perception/understanding that low-bar-enlightenment-perception applies to and extends to all parts of and participants in a project (and connected-projects) including time, not just you (being) here now. (~system-empathy/~system-compassion)
12. Broad Accessibility: The perception/understanding that useful learning can occur without many other dependencies (and is therefore broadly, generally, accessible to participants).
13. That the relationship between data, perception, learning, decisions, actions, and coordination, is not always simple, linear, or automatic.


Detail Notes
Note: This "low-bar enlightenment" approach is ('democratically') broadly accessible to participants requiring minutes to learn rather than myriad lifetimes, does not require all-around perfection of person-ness, is not without context or does not require (somehow) all contexts, is not a reification that combines other abilities and insights to explain and solve all problems in all universes, nor does it include or require all possible types of consciousness, cognition, intelligence, etc.; "Low-bar enlightenment" is one humble step toward navigating the problem-space of problems and systems. 

Note: There may be a limited way to generalize an understanding of perception-maintenance needs ( 'low bar enlightenment' ) to other participants in a way that is consistent with empathy-compassion. Extending an understanding of low bar enlightenment from only your own situation (perceptions, roles, projects, etc.) to being something that applies in a larger space (in which one participates with other participants) to all participants and all other parts of any and all projects (e.g. definitions, signals, perceptions, function-operations, participants, schedules, etc.)(including the effects and spread of system-failure between parts and between participants, between projects, etc.) is, if not sufficient for empathy-and-compassion in a broader or deeper sense, a consistent and concrete step to take towards acting with, or that is consistent-with acting-with, (action, behavior with) empathy-and-compassion, including an understanding of how empathy-compassion relates to STEM and interconnected-intersecting-interlocking areas.

Note: 'Reality' (the meaning used here) is not a single, simple, uniform, static, homogeneous, linear, thing made of only one type of system assumed to fit into a single framework. (e.g. not naive realist positivist) 

Note: Low-bar enlightenment and or definition behavior studies may contradict the description or definition of anything information-related as being tautologically "anti-entropic." E.g. perhaps as a kind of higher-level-noise that ends up reducing signals in a system to the same predictable low-entropy noise. . [You might use the same overall case study of telephone messages traveling from an east coast to a west coast without being altered, degraded, collapsed, noise-ified, lost, etc. Note: Using a moving-water-bottles-logistics project example, the collapse of definitions need not refer to any fuzzy higher-order cultural concepts, with no need to wave arms about 'moot cultural meanings'; low level metric, spec and instruction signal integrity can be the focus. (Another possible analogy-overlap: social-engineering attacks used on purely automated systems.)]

Note: There are many different kinds of non-automatic learning, or many ways that outcomes can be 'invisible,' from elusive past-future connections and non-obvious casual connections, to literally invisible events like radiation, to non-automatic skills such as literacy, to specific biases in a particular system (optical illusions, super-signals etc), to unclear sets of correlations (some of which are incidental), to sometimes confusing system spaces such as indeterminacy(incompetence and malice perhaps) and exponential-elbows(fractal static sometimes and dynamic changing sometimes). And more overtly there is opposition to recognizing the basic concepts themselves: the existence of the phenomena of non-automatic learning, of failures or imperfections in perception, of the existence of basic parts of an agile project, of both the importance of project management and risk of bad planning, the long history of psychological and social barriers to specific and general STEM concepts (including connecting areas of STEM (including by STEM professionals)), etc., even the general issue of not being able to easily see your own biases (or assumptions and context, fish-in-water, hammer-and-nails). Input-output measure may be a helpful tool.

Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 3:
What factors may affect and shape agendas? How might agendas change or drift over time? How do agendas relate to group agreed upon project goals?
Review and comment on activities 1,2

Instrumentalist Modules + Principles, Applications, Narratives
These can-do statements (the goals and agenda for definition behavior studies) can be seen as instrumentalist, modular, recombinant, tool-set areas. We can combine (narrative summaries of) principles and applications with instrumentalist, modular, tool set areas.



Narratives, Principles and Applications:
A mnemonic device can be constructed to cover a narrative survey of principles and applications. One can start with a first introductory pass/sweep through the material in order to map the overall features and layout before doing subsequent sweeps and passes. Using this method of zooming in and zooming out, an increasingly broad and deep model can be constructed and understood. By analogy this approach may be seen as emulating NASA missions that gradually increase in breadth and depth mapping the outside world.


The main tools that we will use to go through the System and Definition Behavior Studies mnemonic include:
1. Examining Perception
2. Tests, especially hypothetico-deductive testing, or hypothesis testing
3. Clear communication
4. Concrete narratives, or stories

Here is an example of a concrete narrative:
An ambassador travels to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda: 
And says:
"Hello, I am an Ambassador.
And I have traveled to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda.
In the galaxy of Andromeda we have a large-scale (intergalactic) diverse (multi-species) highly productive community.
We would like to know if you, homo sapiens and earth, would like to join
our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
Here is an application form.
Please fill it out and tell us what you could bring of value 
to our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
One more thing: Tell us what you know about moving water bottles.
Moving water bottles from one place to another is not a rare and valuable skill.
Moving water bottles is a general universal process.
We would like to know if you have competence with general universal processes.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye, goodbye.
The ambassador leaves."
(end of story-narrative)

Active Learning Project-Assignment 4
Fill out this application, starting with moving-water-bottles; 
Water (as in the case example of moving water( containers)) is a gift that keeps on giving: it is nonsectarian and easily definable.

[The location of the water at a given time is concrete but the processes challenge our assumptions and require better models and participant coordination.]

Gifts that Keep on Giving:
- Timelines are a gift that keeps on giving.
- Moving water is a gift that keeps on giving.
- Meeting the needs of the user/society is a gift that keeps on giving.

Let's start with the moving-water-bottles part of the application-form (from the narrative). 
(The valuable-contribution part will come up later.)

Active Learning Project-Assignment 5: Timeline
Following the story in the sample narrative, we are going to make a timeline. We are going to put all the tools that we can use for moving-water-bottles on a timeline from the oldest known tools such as symbol transactions to the newest tools such as Agile Project Management.

Note: Making a 'technology timeline' is a fabulously useful activity in general, and the kind of skill you can start in 10min and continue for a lifetime.

The end of our timeline (where 'Agile Project Management' is) is also where a goal is. If overly simplistic, we can represent this as a classic (pirate) treasure map:
- rectangle
- arrow
- X

And to further clarify, if overly simplistic: 
- Agile Project Management is the X-marks the spot goal-target on a treasure map;
- This goal-target is what we are looking for;
- This goal is where the agile-user (another target) has needs; 
- This is where ___ target-user (of your project, in this example: all of humanity and society) has needs;
- Meeting the needs of your target-user is a treasure.



 

Boy Scout Values (slightly modified)
A scout is
- trustworthy,
- loyal,
- helpful,
- friendly,
- courteous
- kind,
- obedient,
- cheerful, 
- thrifty
- brave,
- clean, and 
- reverent.

On my honor, I will do my best to, to do my duty to, to guide projects:
- obey the scout law,
- to help other people at all times,
- to keep myself,
- physically strong,
- mentally awake, and 
- morally straight.

Bravery Clause (from Order of The Arrow): internal whistleblowing + external confrontation.

Guidance clause: Duty, Responsibility and Setting-location-items, ancestors, spirituality, and religiosity.
[The attempt here is to generalize the overly specific nationalist and theocratic section of the boy scout code to a more general and scale-flexible context that covers the pragmatic and affirmative topics of community, world, ethical principles, etc. This may dovetail with the Drake-Equation Vessel-Functions that can be concretely described in terms of cross-community disaster relief and disturbance regime management.]

A scout is prepared. Prepared for what?
- To manage down or manage to equilibrium system collapse.
- To manage up or manage to equilibrium system value, function, and meaning. 

Regarding Scout Values: 
1. Universal system of ethics.
2. Rejected because it is a universal system of ethics.
3. Not definable outside of a context.
4. Definable in a project-context (project management framework context).
(So far as I can determine, for the above four items regarding scout values: all four are generally accurate in reality and at the same time all four are not recognized by society as being accurate.)



Active Learning Project-Assignment 6: Give an Agile project-context example for each Boy Scout oath and law area. e.g. Descriptions that highlight the difference between: 
1. projects that succeeded and projects that failed
2. teams that you would choose to work with again, vs. not

Active Learning Project-Assignment 7:
Try to describe and define Boy Scout values without using any context, situations, or examples. 

Active Learning Project-Assignment 8:
Compare the with-context and without-context results and experiences.

(Beginning of Definition Studies Mnemonic Proper)


Active Learning Project-Assignment 9: 
Pick a target and fill out the Mnemonic template. Your target project should include a user or group of users, and something you are aiding those participants with. (See, agile 'user stories')

Mnemonic

The Target is ______ . (e.g. Homo sapiens and Earth, definition behavior studies.)
Hello, my name is ___, the current project location _____ (time, place).

Four Sections:
1.  Value Statements
1.1  Addendum Items
1.2  Participation Array
1.3  Areas of Interaction
2.  Clarification Statements (for contracts)
3.  Standard Error and Damage Report (in four subsections)
4.  Macro-Model




1. Value Statements Section

This project/framework should be generalizable and specifically applicable given an array of 5x5 items:

(Note: 1. Value Statements Section, operational definition of 'help')


Four Addendum Items:

1.1  Setting Location Items:
The water, the wind, the world, best practice, and other:
standards,
elements,
protocols,
gestalts,
symbols, 
signs,
portals, 
pathways,
world-as-unit items and translatable(s),
fractal landscape items,
phases of matter,
phase transitions,
directions, dimensions, (cardinal et al),
post-participants,
linear time,
nonlinear time

Q: Why are we talking about setting-location-items? 
A: 
- Ideal chess boards
- Definitions of insanity
- You have local factors. 
- Other people have different local factors.
- You need policies to cover all these areas.

e.g. The classic example of two internationally distant sister-cities communicating and coordinating about "natural disaster" relief (flood, storm, quake, etc.) and disturbance regimes (modeling/policy/management.) 


2. Love, Act Responsibly Towards, Fulfill Duties Towards
including a framework borrowed from biology containing "comensal",
including:
1. Energy, 
2. Nutrients, 
3. Shannon/Turing Information, 
4. Definition behaviors

Q: Why are we talking about ethics (love, duty, and responsibility)? 
A: There is an epidemic of anti-best-practice action and rhetoric. There should be:
1. a system medicine research area;
2. a system epidemiology task-force.


3. Reception And Reflection:
There is a time for reception and reflection.
I will be receptive and reflective for a [period of] time 
for example 3-5 inhalation-exhalation cycles,
(e.g.)
1 meter squared
1 meter diameter
+/ 
Three ~levels/areas of duty / participation-modes: pre-participant, participant, post-participant


4. Misc:
- Range of Motion
- non-transference (non-automatic learning, non-general learning)
- (policies on) errors and mistakes

2.  Best Practice Blessing: 
"May you, may we, may noun, 
become proficient 
in the sustainable cultivation 
of value, function, and meaning,
via a local implementation 
of generalized system best practice,
with local spice and sauce."
[~'...with local customs and knowledge.']

3.  Learn from mistakes, your mistakes and the mistakes of others. You are the protector of those who cannot or do not learn from mistakes.



2. Clarification Statements Section: 
Disinformation & System Collapse

("Clarification statements" relate to system defense, system immune-system, diagnostics, disinformation, collapse-metrics, weak-points.
Definition of statement to be as clear and unambiguous as possible: "It is bad, it is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.")

Given enough participants, there will be participants who will push to and past the point of system collapse.

(You need to know that collapse happens.
You need to know where and how collapse happens.
You need to know what collapse looks like.
You need to know how to prepare for, prevent, and recover from collapse.)

Whether or not a statement should be clarified is an important item that should be dealt with according to all known best practice standards and protocols; 
1. No unilateral changes to group-agreed-upon goals, means, and methods, and 
2. No unilateral system collapse.


2.  Two Tautology Areas

(Tautology Area 1)
2.1 Tautology Area 1: Three items which are also categories:

2.1.1  Participation: Participating on the behalf of participants without the participation 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.1.2  Best Practice: Mismanaging general-system-management areas 
It is bad, It is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:
2.1.2.1  Having values
2.1.2.2  Valuing Data
2.1.2.3  Communication Reporting Transparency
2.1.2.4  Testing Auditing Feedback
2.1.2.5  No Unilateral System Collapse
2.1.2.6  Proficiency Standards for Time and Schedules

2.1.3  Causality Models: Concept Check: Scapegoating and Elimination: Identifying any entire part of the world as to be scapegoated and eliminated 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

(Tautology Area 2)
2.2 Tautology Area 2: Positive and Negatively Defined Areas ("top and bottom" chart areas)
Identifying system collapse as a goal, not indirectly as in dark lighthouse but directly as in exacerbating system collapse, as part of (defining / in any area of) the standard set of agreed upon goal means method areas, is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it: e.g.

2.2.1  Following worst-possible-options
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.2  Playing nazi-chess
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.3  Mismanaging categories of types of systems
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.4  Mismanaging Cross-Context-Areas: 
e.g.
	- exponential elbows
	- perception abstraction
	- indeterminate incompetence and malice
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.5 Mismanaging Standard System Policy Areas:
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:  
1. Mismanaging Split substantiations: for example 
'they are all good' 
'they are all bad' 
'they should be dealt with by cramming them together or splitting them apart"
2. Golden circle asymmetry / inside outside asymmetry, deleterious effects include: 
- causality, 
- schedules,
- contracts.
3. System inversion (is a standard data artifact)
4. Basal distal disjunction (is a proxy(model) for (operationally defined system) 'violence')
5. Negative choices and definitions (do not ignore them)
6. Turning on and off (running) system processes ((for example) comparing policy from Roman Catholicism, South Korea, and Judaeica)
7. Half-dark dichotomies (more on that later)

Summary Brainstorm 1: concepts of improvement
- naive positivism
- equilibria
- system collapse
- positive and negative definition
- cycles longevity, sequence

Summary Brainstorm 2: STEM
What is the nature of how parts of projects and STEM are (or are not) connected? What are categories of types of systems? How do systems, processes, projects, and definitions fail and collapse? Is there any interface between discussion of ethics, morals, even compassion and mindfulness, and the realm of systems and projects and STEM? What are mistakes? What does it mean to learn or course-correct based on mistakes? Can problem-with-perception be themselves perceived? Can obstacles to learning be overcome by learning about those obstacles? 

Summary Brainstorm 3: Clear & Testable Definitions

Definition Behavior Studies is an interdisciplinary area of study, part Computer Science, statistical process analysis, hypothesis testing, Data Science, religious studies, ethics and mindfulness, and AI.

System and definition behavior studies is the field of study pertaining to the behavior of definitions, in particular collapse behaviors in a context of general system collapse. 

This is an inquiry based approach where we learn by asking questions and where we ask the difficult questions. 
What is the agenda?
What are the goals and modus operandi? 
What is the goals-means-method statement (in a project-context, with project-participants)?


Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 1 
What is your agenda?

Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 2
What are other agendas around studying definition behaviors?
- instructor's/text's agenda
- peer's agendas
- organization's, institution's, culture's agendas
- open and transparent agendas
- conscious agendas
- historical agendas, future agendas, present agendas
- misprision and agendas ('to guide')
- improvement and collapse of agendas
- J.M.Keynes on [misunderstanding one's own] Agendas
- other categories you can add

(I will try to have an open-agenda here and lay out what (at least I think) my agenda is. The following open-agenda happens to fit right in with, and can be a template for, the part of the workflow-process of a project where you draw up, and coordinate decisions about, a group-agreed-upon-goal-means-methods-statement, a preliminary checklist that can guide discussion of what people agree to for a project.)

Goals (Agenda): goals-means-method statement / "we-can" statements:
We can succeed. 
We can make things work. 
We can understand what is wrong.
We can fix what is broken. 
We can use not-automatically-learned skills &  not-automatically-transferred skills.
We can use STEM to connect signals and reality.
We can connect STEM, project-management, and ethics.
We can use intersecting-interlocking-interconnecting areas.
We can learn, coordinate, and solve problems.
We can manage types of, and terms for, generalization.
We can use "low-bar enlightenment."
We can extend into or maintain a full range of motion, not only contraction(reducing/narrowing).
We can participate to complete projects.
We can learn from and correct the mistakes of the past.
We can use and understand the effects of perception and abstraction.
We can make and use tools and resources.
We can use feedback, testability, measurability, & definability.
We can use patterns, protocols, and processes for and with skills, abilities, and learning. 
We can communicate.
We can make progress.


We can generalize; We can distinguish between, and use, types of (and terms for) generalization. 
We can generalize STEM.
We can generalize participation.
We can generalize projects (project-context).
We can generalize decision-coordination (voting etc).
We can generalize indirectly defined Value-Function-&-Meaning (non-collapse).
We can generalize object-relationship-spaces. 
We can generalize categories of types of systems.
We can generalize system-fitness and system-epidemiology.
We can generalize data-hygiene, system hygiene.
We can generalize system collapse.
We can generalize system defense, system health, system-immune-systems, information-immune-systems, system information-epidemiology, and system-and-definition-membranes.
We can generalize disinformation vs. definition-clarification.
We can generalize Signal-Data Processing and/vs. Instruction Management.
We can generalize System-Externalization, task/step derivation/integration, and task/process-modularity.


We Can Use "Low-Bar Enlightenment":
	(Summary)
We can use the idea of 'being trapped in potentially endless cycles of ~"rebirth" due to ~"ignorance" ' as a metaphor/analogy/simile/paradigmatic-model/example for repeated project-failures, where a lack of perception / understanding of the causes of project-failure is involved in self-perpetuating feedback cycles leading to such repeating failures (with invisible or misunderstood causes): 
The goal is ending cycles of being endlessly-'reborn' into mismanaged-projects that unnecessarily-fail in the same correctable, but uncorrected, ways over and over again.
We can learn to perceive invisible (or previously unperceived and / or not-automatically-perceived) causes of failure and collapse ((definable, measurable, testable, falsifiable) project, system, definition failure and collapse), where this failure and collapse (this system-state of failure-collapse) can be the default state(s)/equilibrium(ia) that systems move and iterate towards.
We can stop these cycles of failure by using information/data, perception, and learning.


Low-Bar Enlightenment (elements of):
1. The perception/understanding that repeating cycles of failed actions and projects can result from errors in perception and planning (a proverbial 'wheel of samsara').
2. The perception/understanding that indefinately-repeating cycles-of-failed actions and projects can exist without inevitable-automatic-learning arising from raw feedback of experiential data about that failure. 
I.e., learning (that is sufficient to prevent the problem in future) does not automatically result from experiencing mistakes or overall-system-shocks, etc.
[Possibly related to ~'cultural/epiphenomena'-learning as an additional layer:  Q: How are "internally"-invisible skills/abilities/patterns learned? A: "Externally"?]
3. The perception/understanding that perception/understanding can be fooled in principle and in practice.
4. The perception/understanding that learning-from-failures does not happen automatically, and can indefinitely not-happen.
5. The perception/understanding that learning-from-failures does not transfer automatically from one perceived-recognized-learned area to other areas, and can indefinitely not-transfer.
6. The perception/understanding that non-automatic-learning and invisible-problems are not solved by 'system shocks,' the use of violence, or arbitrary low level (basal) system changes (also see basal-distal disjunctions).
7. The perception/understanding that models of causality can be wrong in principle and in practice.
8. The perception/understanding that plans/goals can be incorrectly defined (so that plans are not followed or follow-able as defined, and goals are not achieved or achievable as defined).
9.  The perception/understanding that each participant's set of the shared definitions of the goals-and-structure-of-a-project can/will erode, weather, corrode, contract, deform and collapse (by default) unless properly configured and continually and actively maintained and repaired. There is no static definition/perception/understanding equilibrium: Staying connected to reality requires constant fitness-training, data-hygiene, and upkeep. 
(Universality Question: specific biology[intelligence] vs. general[ai, etc]?)
10.  The perception/understanding that there are different types of non-automatic learning.
11.  The perception/understanding that low-bar-enlightenment-perception applies to and extends to all parts of and participants in a project (and connected-projects) including time, not just you (being) here now. (~system-empathy/~system-compassion)
12. Broad Accessibility: The perception/understanding that useful learning can occur without many other dependencies (and is therefore broadly, generally, accessible to participants).
13. That the relationship between data, perception, learning, decisions, actions, and coordination, is not always simple, linear, or automatic.


Detail Notes
Note: This "low-bar enlightenment" approach is ('democratically') broadly accessible to participants requiring minutes to learn rather than myriad lifetimes, does not require all-around perfection of person-ness, is not without context or does not require (somehow) all contexts, is not a reification that combines other abilities and insights to explain and solve all problems in all universes, nor does it include or require all possible types of consciousness, cognition, intelligence, etc.; "Low-bar enlightenment" is one humble step toward navigating the problem-space of problems and systems. 

Note: There may be a limited way to generalize an understanding of perception-maintenance needs ( 'low bar enlightenment' ) to other participants in a way that is consistent with empathy-compassion. Extending an understanding of low bar enlightenment from only your own situation (perceptions, roles, projects, etc.) to being something that applies in a larger space (in which one participates with other participants) to all participants and all other parts of any and all projects (e.g. definitions, signals, perceptions, function-operations, participants, schedules, etc.)(including the effects and spread of system-failure between parts and between participants, between projects, etc.) is, if not sufficient for empathy-and-compassion in a broader or deeper sense, a consistent and concrete step to take towards acting with, or that is consistent-with acting-with, (action, behavior with) empathy-and-compassion, including an understanding of how empathy-compassion relates to STEM and interconnected-intersecting-interlocking areas.

Note: 'Reality' (the meaning used here) is not a single, simple, uniform, static, homogeneous, linear, thing made of only one type of system assumed to fit into a single framework. (e.g. not naive realist positivist) 

Note: Low-bar enlightenment and or definition behavior studies may contradict the description or definition of anything information-related as being tautologically "anti-entropic." E.g. perhaps as a kind of higher-level-noise that ends up reducing signals in a system to the same predictable low-entropy noise. . [You might use the same overall case study of telephone messages traveling from an east coast to a west coast without being altered, degraded, collapsed, noise-ified, lost, etc. Note: Using a moving-water-bottles-logistics project example, the collapse of definitions need not refer to any fuzzy higher-order cultural concepts, with no need to wave arms about 'moot cultural meanings'; low level metric, spec and instruction signal integrity can be the focus. (Another possible analogy-overlap: social-engineering attacks used on purely automated systems.)]

Note: There are many different kinds of non-automatic learning, or many ways that outcomes can be 'invisible,' from elusive past-future connections and non-obvious casual connections, to literally invisible events like radiation, to non-automatic skills such as literacy, to specific biases in a particular system (optical illusions, super-signals etc), to unclear sets of correlations (some of which are incidental), to sometimes confusing system spaces such as indeterminacy(incompetence and malice perhaps) and exponential-elbows(fractal static sometimes and dynamic changing sometimes). And more overtly there is opposition to recognizing the basic concepts themselves: the existence of the phenomena of non-automatic learning, of failures or imperfections in perception, of the existence of basic parts of an agile project, of both the importance of project management and risk of bad planning, the long history of psychological and social barriers to specific and general STEM concepts (including connecting areas of STEM (including by STEM professionals)), etc., even the general issue of not being able to easily see your own biases (or assumptions and context, "fish in water", "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.", "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”― Upton Sinclair). Input-output measure may be a helpful tool.

Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 3:
What factors may affect and shape agendas? 
How might agendas change or drift over time? 
How do agendas relate to group agreed upon project goals?
Review and comment on activities 1 and 2.
Note the distinction between 'can' and 'should' with the above text focusing on available options and consensus across contexts, vs. the significant details of coordinating decisions on what should be appropriate in a specific context.
Are there any 'can' statements that you see as items that can be done but which are left off your list of group agreed upon goals, means, and methods (e.g. for a narrow do-one-thing-well project or some other justification)? 


Instrumentalist Modules + Principles, Applications, Narratives
These can-do statements (the goals and agenda for definition behavior studies) can be seen as instrumentalist, modular, recombinant, tool-set areas. We can combine (narrative summaries of) principles and applications with instrumentalist, modular, tool set areas.



Narratives, Principles and Applications:
A mnemonic device can be constructed to cover a narrative survey of principles and applications. One can start with a first introductory pass/sweep through the material (introducing the principles and applications of definition-behavior studies) in order to map the overall features and layout before doing subsequent sweeps and passes. Using this method of zooming in and zooming out, an increasingly broad and deep model can be constructed and understood. By analogy this approach may be seen as emulating NASA missions that gradually increase in breadth and depth mapping the outside world.


The main tools that we will use to go through the System and Definition Behavior Studies mnemonic include:
1. Examining Perception
2. Tests & Feedback, especially hypothetico-deductive testing, or hypothesis testing
3. Clear communication
4. Concrete narratives, or stories

Here is an example of a concrete narrative:
An ambassador travels to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda: 
And says:
"Hello, I am an Ambassador.
And I have traveled to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda.
In the galaxy of Andromeda we have a large-scale (intergalactic) diverse (multi-species) highly productive community.
We would like to know if you, homo sapiens and earth, would like to join
our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
Here is an application form.
Please fill it out and tell us what you could bring of value 
to our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
One more thing: Tell us what you know about moving water bottles.
Moving water bottles from one place to another is not a rare and valuable skill.
Moving water bottles is a general universal process.
We would like to know if you have competence with general universal processes.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye, goodbye.
The ambassador leaves."
(end of story-narrative)


Active Learning Project-Assignment 4
Fill out this application, starting with moving-water-bottles. 


Let's start with the moving-water-bottles part of the application-form (from the narrative). 
(The valuable-contribution part will come up later.)

Water (as in the case example of moving water( containers)) is a gift that keeps on giving: it is nonsectarian and it is easily definable.

[The location of the water at a given time is concrete but the processes challenge our assumptions and require better models and participant coordination.]

Gifts that Keep on Giving:
- Timelines are a gift that keeps on giving.
- Moving water is a gift that keeps on giving.
- Meeting the needs of the user/society is a gift that keeps on giving.

Active Learning Project-Assignment 5: Timeline
Following the story in the sample narrative, we are going to make a timeline. We are going to put all the tools that we can use for moving-water-bottles on a timeline from the oldest known tools such as symbol transactions to the newest tools such as Agile Project Management.

Note: Making a 'technology timeline' is a fabulously useful activity in general, and the kind of skill you can start in 10min and continue for a lifetime.

The end of our timeline (where 'Agile Project Management' is) is also where a goal is. If overly simplistic, we can represent this as a classic (pirate) treasure map:
- rectangle
- arrow
- X

And to further clarify and simplify: 
- Agile Project Management is the X-marks the spot goal-target on a treasure map;
- This goal-target is what we are looking for;
- This goal is where the agile-user (another target) has needs; 
- This is where ___ target-user (of your project, in this example: all of humanity and society) has needs;
- Meeting the needs of your target-user is a treasure.



 

Boy Scout Values (slightly modified)
A scout is
- trustworthy,
- loyal,
- helpful,
- friendly,
- courteous
- kind,
- obedient,
- cheerful, 
- thrifty
- brave,
- clean, and 
- reverent.

On my honor, I will do my best to, to do my duty to, to guide projects:
- obey the scout law,
- to help other people at all times,
- to keep myself,
- physically strong,
- mentally awake, and 
- morally straight.

Bravery Clause (from Order of The Arrow): internal whistleblowing + external confrontation.

Guidance clause: Duty, Responsibility and Setting-location-items, ancestors, spirituality, and religiosity.
[The attempt here is to generalize the overly specific nationalist and theocratic section of the boy scout code to a more general and scale-flexible context that covers the pragmatic and affirmative topics of community, world, ethical principles, etc. This may dovetail with the Drake-Equation Vessel-Functions that can be concretely described in terms of cross-community disaster relief and disturbance regime management.]

A scout is prepared. Prepared for what?
- To manage down or manage to equilibrium system collapse.
- To manage up or manage to equilibrium system value, function, and meaning. 

Regarding Scout Values: 
1. Universal system of ethics.
2. Rejected because it is a universal system of ethics.
3. Not definable outside of a context.
4. Definable in a project-context (project management framework context).
(So far as I can determine, for the above four items regarding scout values: all four are generally accurate in reality and at the same time all four are not recognized by society as being accurate.)



Active Learning Project-Assignment 6: 
Give an Agile project-context example for each Boy Scout oath and law area. e.g. Descriptions that highlight the difference between: 
1. Projects that succeeded and projects that failed,
2. Teams that you would choose to work with again vs. not.


Active Learning Project-Assignment 7:
Try to describe and define Boy Scout values without using any context, situations, or examples. 

Active Learning Project-Assignment 8:
Compare the with-context and without-context results and experiences.

Active Learning Project-Assignment 9: 
Pick a target and fill out the Mnemonic template. Your target project should include a user or group of users, and something you are aiding those participants with. (See, agile 'user stories')

Mnemonic

The Target is ______ . (e.g. Homo sapiens and Earth, definition behavior studies.)
Hello, my name is ___, the current project location _____ (time, place).

Four Sections:
1.  Value Statements
1.1  Addendum Items
1.2  Participation Array
1.3  Areas of Interaction
2.  Clarification Statements (for contracts)
3.  Standard Error and Damage Report (in four subsections)
4.  Macro-Model




1. Value Statements Section

This project/framework should be generalizable and specifically applicable given an array of 5x5 items:

(Note: 1. Value Statements Section, operational definition of 'help')


Four Addendum Items:

1.1  Setting Location Items:
The water, the wind, the world, best practice, and other:
standards,

pathways,
world-as-unit items and translatable(s),
fractal landscape items,
phases of matter,
phase transitions,
directions, dimensions, (cardinal et al),
post-participants,
linear time,
nonlinear time

Q: Why are we talking about setting-location-items? 
A: 
- Ideal chess boards
- Definitions of insanity
- You have local factors. 
- Other people have different local factors.
- You need policies to cover all these areas.

e.g. The classic example of two internationally distant sister-cities communicating and coordinating about "natural disaster" relief (flood, storm, quake, etc.) and disturbance regimes (modeling/policy/management.) 


2. Love, Act Responsibly Towards, Fulfill Duties Towards
including a framework borrowed from biology containing "comensal",
including:
1. Energy, 
2. Nutrients, 
3. Shannon/Turing Information, 
4. Definition behaviors

Q: Why are we talking about ethics (love, duty, and responsibility)? 
A: There is an epidemic of anti-best-practice action and rhetoric. There should be:
1. a system medicine research area;
2. a system epidemiology task-force.


3. Reception And Reflection:
There is a time for reception and reflection.
I will be receptive and reflective for a [period of] time 
for example 3-5 inhalation-exhalation cycles,
(e.g.)
1 meter squared
1 meter diameter
+/ 
Three ~levels/areas of duty / participation-modes: pre-participant, participant, post-participant


4. Misc:
- Range of Motion
- non-transference (non-automatic learning, non-general learning)
- (policies on) errors and mistakes

(This should be generalizable and specifically applicable given an array of 5x5 items.)
1. Participation Items
2. Setting Location Items
3. Definition Behavior Items
4. Proximity, Scale, Contact, Interaction, Exposure Items

Connection, disconnection, and ambiguity, in the following areas:
1.1 time space location
1.2 perception
1.3 action
1.4 experience
1.5 votes on goals means methods


(2&3)
Operational Definition of "Help":

2. Giving Help
3. Receiving Help
Operational Definition of "Help":
'Help' is defined as deploying a feature that meets the stated, and indicated, needs and goals of a user.


4. Drake Equation Vessel Functions: in the following seven areas
Sub-Participants can, should, will, want to, do, help, and / or help with, serve, and / or serve with, setting-location-items in a legal vessel-capacity occupational role and niche and offer legal-vessel-contracts in the following ~seven areas:

4.1  Sensory Motor (Lear: Use My Eyes) Areas (Plus Electromagnetism)
4.2  Benzaiten Saraswati Areas (Plus historical continuity, minus high definition input output data-literacy/numeracy) (Note: translation and transmission)
?4.3  Embodyment / Channeling Items: theater-groups and community interaction, CRV, active-imagination
4.4  Functions and Operations:

4.4.5 Cross Context Areas

5. Definition Dark Areas / off the one-tree

6. World Dancing, World Singing: the song and dance of compromise

7. Professional Technical Production Advice: six sigma for rivers, grains of sand, ecosystems, keystone species

8. "Help others at all times":

1.  I will do my best to help all parties according to all known best practice standards and protocols; to manage down or manage to equilibrium system-collapse, to manage up or manage to equilibrium system-value-function-and-meaning.

2.  Best Practice Blessing: 
"May you, may we, may noun, 
become proficient 
in the sustainable cultivation 
of value, function, and meaning,
via a local implementation 
of generalized system best practice,
with local spice and sauce."
[~'...with local customs and knowledge.']

3.  Learn from mistakes, your mistakes and the mistakes of others. You are the protector of those who cannot or do not learn from mistakes.



2. Clarification Statements Section: 
Disinformation & System Collapse

("Clarification statements" relate to system defense, system immune-system, diagnostics, disinformation, collapse-metrics, weak-points.
Definition of statement to be as clear and unambiguous as possible: "It is bad, it is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.")

Given enough participants, there will be participants who will push to and past the point of system collapse.

(You need to know that collapse happens.
You need to know where and how collapse happens.
You need to know what collapse looks like.
You need to know how to prepare for, prevent, and recover from collapse.)

Whether or not a statement should be clarified is an important item that should be dealt with according to all known best practice standards and protocols; 
1. No unilateral changes to group-agreed-upon goals, means, and methods, and 
2. No unilateral system collapse.


2.  Two Tautology Areas

(Tautology Area 1)
2.1 Tautology Area 1: Three items which are also categories:

2.1.1  Participation: Participating on the behalf of participants without the participation 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.1.2  Best Practice: Mismanaging general-system-management areas 
It is bad, It is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:
2.1.2.1  Having values
2.1.2.2  Valuing Data
2.1.2.3  Communication Reporting Transparency
2.1.2.4  Testing Auditing Feedback
2.1.2.5  No Unilateral System Collapse
2.1.2.6  Proficiency Standards for Time and Schedules

2.1.3  Causality Models: Concept Check: Scapegoating and Elimination: Identifying any entire part of the world as to be scapegoated and eliminated 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

(Tautology Area 2)
2.2 Tautology Area 2: Positive and Negatively Defined Areas ("top and bottom" chart areas)
Identifying system collapse as a goal, not indirectly as in dark lighthouse but directly as in exacerbating system collapse, as part of (defining / in any area of) the standard set of agreed upon goal means method areas, is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it: e.g.

2.2.1  Following worst-possible-options
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.2  Playing nazi-chess
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.3  Mismanaging categories of types of systems
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.4  Mismanaging Cross-Context-Areas: 
e.g.
	- exponential elbows
	- perception abstraction
	- indeterminate incompetence and malice
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.5 Mismanaging Standard System Policy Areas:
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:  
1. Mismanaging Split substantiations: for example 
'they are all good' 
'they are all bad' 
'they should be dealt with by cramming them together or splitting them apart"
2. Golden circle asymmetry / inside outside asymmetry, deleterious effects include: 
- causality, 
- schedules,
- contracts.
3. System inversion (is a standard data artifact)
4. Basal distal disjunction (is a proxy(model) for (operationally defined system) 'violence')
5. Negative choices and definitions (do not ignore them)
6. Turning on and off (running) system processes ((for example) comparing policy from Roman Catholicism, South Korea, and Judaeica)
7. Half-dark dichotomies (more on that later)

2. Body: Parkinson's Body-Extension Exercises/Yoga
https://github.com/lineality/parkinsons_resources 
3. Language: 般若心経 (link)

Summary Brainstorm 1: concepts of improvement
- naive positivism
- equilibria
- system collapse
- positive and negative definition
- cycles longevity, sequence

Summary Brainstorm 2: STEM
What is the nature of how parts of projects and STEM are (or are not) connected? What are categories of types of systems? How do systems, processes, projects, and definitions fail and collapse? Is there any interface between discussion of ethics, morals, even compassion and mindfulness, and the realm of systems and projects and STEM? What are mistakes? What does it mean to learn or course-correct based on mistakes? Can problem-with-perception be themselves perceived? Can obstacles to learning be overcome by learning about those obstacles? 

Summary Brainstorm 3: Clear & Testable Definitions
- What definitions are not sufficiently clear or testable?

Definition Behavior Studies is an interdisciplinary area of study, part Computer Science, statistical process analysis, hypothesis testing, Data Science, religious studies, ethics and mindfulness, and AI.

System and definition behavior studies is the field of study pertaining to the behavior of definitions, in particular collapse behaviors in a context of general system collapse. 

This is an inquiry based approach where we learn by asking questions and where we ask the difficult questions. 
What is the agenda?
What are the goals and modus operandi? 
What is the goals-means-method statement (in a project-context, with project-participants)?


Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 1 
What is your agenda?

Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 2
What are other agendas around studying definition behaviors?
- instructor's/text's agenda
- peer's agendas
- organization's, institution's, culture's agendas
- open and transparent agendas
- conscious agendas
- historical agendas, future agendas, present agendas
- misprision and agendas ('to guide')
- improvement and collapse of agendas
- J.M.Keynes on [misunderstanding one's own] Agendas
- other categories you can add

(I will try to have an open-agenda here and lay out what (at least I think) my agenda is. The following open-agenda happens to fit right in with, and can be a template for, the part of the workflow-process of a project where you draw up, and coordinate decisions about, a group-agreed-upon-goal-means-methods-statement, a preliminary checklist that can guide discussion of what people agree to for a project.)

Goals (Agenda): goals-means-method statement / "we-can" statements:
We can succeed. 
We can make things work. 
We can understand what is wrong.
We can fix what is broken. 
We can use not-automatically-learned skills &  not-automatically-transferred skills.
We can use STEM to connect signals and reality.
We can connect STEM, project-management, and ethics.
We can use intersecting-interlocking-interconnecting areas.
We can learn, coordinate, and solve problems.
We can manage types of, and terms for, generalization.
We can use "low-bar enlightenment."
We can extend into or maintain a full range of motion, not only contraction(reducing/narrowing).
We can participate to complete projects.
We can learn from and correct the mistakes of the past.
We can use and understand the effects of perception and abstraction.
We can make and use tools and resources.
We can use feedback, testability, measurability, & definability.
We can use patterns, protocols, and processes for and with skills, abilities, and learning. 
We can communicate.
We can make progress.


We can generalize; We can distinguish between, and use, types of (and terms for) generalization. 
We can generalize STEM.
We can generalize participation.
We can generalize projects (project-context).
We can generalize decision-coordination (voting etc).
We can generalize indirectly defined Value-Function-&-Meaning (non-collapse).
We can generalize object-relationship-spaces. 
We can generalize categories of types of systems.
We can generalize system-fitness and system-epidemiology.
We can generalize data-hygiene, system hygiene.
We can generalize system collapse.
We can generalize system defense, system health, system-immune-systems, information-immune-systems, system information-epidemiology, and system-and-definition-membranes.
We can generalize disinformation vs. definition-clarification.
We can generalize Signal-Data Processing and/vs. Instruction Management.
We can generalize System-Externalization, task/step derivation/integration, and task/process-modularity.


We Can Use "Low-Bar Enlightenment":
	(Summary)
We can use the idea of 'being trapped in potentially endless cycles of ~"rebirth" due to ~"ignorance" ' as a metaphor/analogy/simile/paradigmatic-model/example for repeated project-failures, where a lack of perception / understanding of the causes of project-failure is involved in self-perpetuating feedback cycles leading to such repeating failures (with invisible or misunderstood causes): 
The goal is ending cycles of being endlessly-'reborn' into mismanaged-projects that unnecessarily-fail in the same correctable, but uncorrected, ways over and over again.
We can learn to perceive invisible (or previously unperceived and / or not-automatically-perceived) causes of failure and collapse ((definable, measurable, testable, falsifiable) project, system, definition failure and collapse), where this failure and collapse (this system-state of failure-collapse) can be the default state(s)/equilibrium(ia) that systems move and iterate towards.
We can stop these cycles of failure by using information/data, perception, and learning.


Low-Bar Enlightenment (elements of):
1. The perception/understanding that repeating cycles of failed actions and projects can result from errors in perception and planning (a proverbial 'wheel of samsara').
2. The perception/understanding that indefinately-repeating cycles-of-failed actions and projects can exist without inevitable-automatic-learning arising from raw feedback of experiential data about that failure. 
I.e., learning (that is sufficient to prevent the problem in future) does not automatically result from experiencing mistakes or overall-system-shocks, etc.
[Possibly related to ~'cultural/epiphenomena'-learning as an additional layer:  Q: How are "internally"-invisible skills/abilities/patterns learned? A: "Externally"?]
3. The perception/understanding that perception/understanding can be fooled in principle and in practice.
4. The perception/understanding that learning-from-failures does not happen automatically, and can indefinitely not-happen.
5. The perception/understanding that learning-from-failures does not transfer automatically from one perceived-recognized-learned area to other areas, and can indefinitely not-transfer.
6. The perception/understanding that non-automatic-learning and invisible-problems are not solved by 'system shocks,' the use of violence, or arbitrary low level (basal) system changes (also see basal-distal disjunctions).
7. The perception/understanding that models of causality can be wrong in principle and in practice.
8. The perception/understanding that plans/goals can be incorrectly defined (so that plans are not followed or follow-able as defined, and goals are not achieved or achievable as defined).
9.  The perception/understanding that each participant's set of the shared definitions of the goals-and-structure-of-a-project can/will erode, weather, corrode, contract, deform and collapse (by default) unless properly configured and continually and actively maintained and repaired. There is no static definition/perception/understanding equilibrium: Staying connected to reality requires constant fitness-training, data-hygiene, and upkeep. 
(Universality Question: specific biology[intelligence] vs. general[ai, etc]?)
10.  The perception/understanding that there are different types of non-automatic learning.
11.  The perception/understanding that low-bar-enlightenment-perception applies to and extends to all parts of and participants in a project (and connected-projects) including time, not just you (being) here now. (~system-empathy/~system-compassion)
12. Broad Accessibility: The perception/understanding that useful learning can occur without many other dependencies (and is therefore broadly, generally, accessible to participants).
13. That the relationship between data, perception, learning, decisions, actions, and coordination, is not always simple, linear, or automatic.


Detail Notes
Note: This "low-bar enlightenment" approach is ('democratically') broadly accessible to participants requiring minutes to learn rather than myriad lifetimes, does not require all-around perfection of person-ness, is not without context or does not require (somehow) all contexts, is not a reification that combines other abilities and insights to explain and solve all problems in all universes, nor does it include or require all possible types of consciousness, cognition, intelligence, etc.; "Low-bar enlightenment" is one humble step toward navigating the problem-space of problems and systems. 

Note: There may be a limited way to generalize an understanding of perception-maintenance needs ( 'low bar enlightenment' ) to other participants in a way that is consistent with empathy-compassion. Extending an understanding of low bar enlightenment from only your own situation (perceptions, roles, projects, etc.) to being something that applies in a larger space (in which one participates with other participants) to all participants and all other parts of any and all projects (e.g. definitions, signals, perceptions, function-operations, participants, schedules, etc.)(including the effects and spread of system-failure between parts and between participants, between projects, etc.) is, if not sufficient for empathy-and-compassion in a broader or deeper sense, a consistent and concrete step to take towards acting with, or that is consistent-with acting-with, (action, behavior with) empathy-and-compassion, including an understanding of how empathy-compassion relates to STEM and interconnected-intersecting-interlocking areas.

Note: 'Reality' (the meaning used here) is not a single, simple, uniform, static, homogeneous, linear, thing made of only one type of system assumed to fit into a single framework. (e.g. not naive realist positivist) 

Note: Low-bar enlightenment and or definition behavior studies may contradict the description or definition of anything information-related as being tautologically "anti-entropic." E.g. perhaps as a kind of higher-level-noise that ends up reducing signals in a system to the same predictable low-entropy noise. . [You might use the same overall case study of telephone messages traveling from an east coast to a west coast without being altered, degraded, collapsed, noise-ified, lost, etc. Note: Using a moving-water-bottles-logistics project example, the collapse of definitions need not refer to any fuzzy higher-order cultural concepts, with no need to wave arms about 'moot cultural meanings'; low level metric, spec and instruction signal integrity can be the focus. (Another possible analogy-overlap: social-engineering attacks used on purely automated systems.)]

Note: There are many different kinds of non-automatic learning, or many ways that outcomes can be 'invisible,' from elusive past-future connections and non-obvious casual connections, to literally invisible events like radiation, to non-automatic skills such as literacy, to specific biases in a particular system (optical illusions, super-signals etc), to unclear sets of correlations (some of which are incidental), to sometimes confusing system spaces such as indeterminacy(incompetence and malice perhaps) and exponential-elbows(fractal static sometimes and dynamic changing sometimes). And more overtly there is opposition to recognizing the basic concepts themselves: the existence of the phenomena of non-automatic learning, of failures or imperfections in perception, of the existence of basic parts of an agile project, of both the importance of project management and risk of bad planning, the long history of psychological and social barriers to specific and general STEM concepts (including connecting areas of STEM (including by STEM professionals)), etc., even the general issue of not being able to easily see your own biases (or assumptions and context, "fish in water", "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.", "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”― Upton Sinclair). Input-output measure may be a helpful tool.

Active-Learning Project-Assignment Activity 3:
What factors may affect and shape agendas? 
How might agendas change or drift over time? 
How do agendas relate to group agreed upon project goals?
Review and comment on activities 1 and 2.
Note the distinction between 'can' and 'should' with the above text focusing on available options and consensus across contexts, vs. the significant details of coordinating decisions on what should be appropriate in a specific context.
Are there any 'can' statements that you see as items that can be done but which are left off your list of group agreed upon goals, means, and methods (e.g. for a narrow do-one-thing-well project or some other justification)? 


Instrumentalist Modules + Principles, Applications, Narratives
These can-do statements (the goals and agenda for definition behavior studies) can be seen as instrumentalist, modular, recombinant, tool-set areas. We can combine (narrative summaries of) principles and applications with instrumentalist, modular, tool set areas.



Narratives, Principles and Applications:
A mnemonic device can be constructed to cover a narrative survey of principles and applications. One can start with a first introductory pass/sweep through the material (introducing the principles and applications of definition-behavior studies) in order to map the overall features and layout before doing subsequent sweeps and passes. Using this method of zooming in and zooming out, an increasingly broad and deep model can be constructed and understood. By analogy this approach may be seen as emulating NASA missions that gradually increase in breadth and depth mapping the outside world.


The main tools that we will use to go through the System and Definition Behavior Studies mnemonic include:
1. Examining Perception
2. Tests & Feedback, especially hypothetico-deductive testing, or hypothesis testing
3. Clear communication
4. Concrete narratives, or stories

Here is an example of a concrete narrative:
An ambassador travels to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda: 
And says:
"Hello, I am an Ambassador.
And I have traveled to earth from the galaxy of Andromeda.
In the galaxy of Andromeda we have a large-scale (intergalactic) diverse (multi-species) highly productive community.
We would like to know if you, homo sapiens and earth, would like to join
our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
Here is an application form.
Please fill it out and tell us what you could bring of value 
to our large-scale (intergalactic), diverse (multi species), highly productive community.
One more thing: Tell us what you know about moving water bottles.
Moving water bottles from one place to another is not a rare and valuable skill.
Moving water bottles is a general universal process.
We would like to know if you have competence with general universal processes.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye, goodbye.
The ambassador leaves."
(end of story-narrative)


Active Learning Project-Assignment 4
Fill out this application, starting with moving-water-bottles. 


Let's start with the moving-water-bottles part of the application-form (from the narrative). 
(The valuable-contribution part will come up later.)

Water (as in the case example of moving water( containers)) is a gift that keeps on giving: it is nonsectarian and it is easily definable.

[The location of the water at a given time is concrete but the processes challenge our assumptions and require better models and participant coordination.]

Gifts that Keep on Giving:
- Timelines are a gift that keeps on giving.
- Moving water is a gift that keeps on giving.
- Meeting the needs of the user/society is a gift that keeps on giving.

Active Learning Project-Assignment 5: Timeline
Following the story in the sample narrative, we are going to make a timeline. We are going to put all the tools that we can use for moving-water-bottles on a timeline from the oldest known tools such as symbol transactions to the newest tools such as Agile Project Management.

Note: Making a 'technology timeline' is a fabulously useful activity in general, and the kind of skill you can start in 10min and continue for a lifetime.

The end of our timeline (where 'Agile Project Management' is) is also where a goal is. If overly simplistic, we can represent this as a classic (pirate) treasure map:
- rectangle
- arrow
- X

And to further clarify and simplify: 
- Agile Project Management is the X-marks the spot goal-target on a treasure map;
- This goal-target is what we are looking for;
- This goal is where the agile-user (another target) has needs; 
- This is where ___ target-user (of your project, in this example: all of humanity and society) has needs;
- Meeting the needs of your target-user is a treasure.



 

Boy Scout Values (slightly modified)
A scout is
- trustworthy,
- loyal,
- helpful,
- friendly,
- courteous
- kind,
- obedient,
- cheerful, 
- thrifty
- brave,
- clean, and 
- reverent.

On my honor, I will do my best to, to do my duty to, to guide projects:
- obey the scout law,
- to help other people at all times,
- to keep myself,
- physically strong,
- mentally awake, and 
- morally straight.

Bravery Clause (from Order of The Arrow): internal whistleblowing + external confrontation.

Guidance clause: Duty, Responsibility and Setting-location-items, ancestors, spirituality, and religiosity.
[The attempt here is to generalize the overly specific nationalist and theocratic section of the boy scout code to a more general and scale-flexible context that covers the pragmatic and affirmative topics of community, world, ethical principles, etc. This may dovetail with the Drake-Equation Vessel-Functions that can be concretely described in terms of cross-community disaster relief and disturbance regime management.]

A scout is prepared. Prepared for what?
- To manage down or manage to equilibrium system collapse.
- To manage up or manage to equilibrium system value, function, and meaning. 

Regarding Scout Values: 
1. Universal system of ethics.
2. Rejected because it is a universal system of ethics.
3. Not definable outside of a context.
4. Definable in a project-context (project management framework context).
(So far as I can determine, for the above four items regarding scout values: all four are generally accurate in reality and at the same time all four are not recognized by society as being accurate.)



Active Learning Project-Assignment 6: 
Give an Agile project-context example for each Boy Scout oath and law area. e.g. Descriptions that highlight the difference between: 
1. Projects that succeeded and projects that failed,
2. Teams that you would choose to work with again vs. not.


Active Learning Project-Assignment 7:
Try to describe and define Boy Scout values without using any context, situations, or examples. 

Active Learning Project-Assignment 8:
Compare the with-context and without-context results and experiences.

(end of introduction to mnemonic)
(Beginning of Definition Studies Mnemonic Proper)


Active Learning Project-Assignment 9: 
Pick a target and fill out the Mnemonic template. Your target project should include a user or group of users, and something you are aiding those participants with. (See, agile 'user stories')

Mnemonic

The Target is ______ . (e.g. Homo sapiens and Earth, definition behavior studies.)
Hello, my name is ___, the current project location _____ (time, place).

Four Sections:
1.  Value Statements
1.1  Addendum Items
1.2  Participation Array
1.3  Areas of Interaction
2.  Clarification Statements (for contracts)
3.  Standard Error and Damage Report (in four subsections)
4.  Macro-Model




1. Value Statements Section

This project/framework should be generalizable and specifically applicable given an array of 5x5 items:

(Note: 1. Value Statements Section, operational definition of 'help')


Four Addendum Items:

1.1  Setting Location Items:
The water, the wind, the world, best practice, and other:
standards,
elements,
protocols,
gestalts,

pathways,
world-as-unit items and translatable(s),
fractal landscape items,
phases of matter,
phase transitions,
directions, dimensions, (cardinal et al),
post-participants,
linear time,
nonlinear time

Q: Why are we talking about setting-location-items? 
A: 
- Ideal chess boards
- Definitions of insanity
- You have local factors. 
- Other people have different local factors.
- You need policies to cover all these areas.

e.g. The classic example of two internationally distant sister-cities communicating and coordinating about "natural disaster" relief (flood, storm, quake, etc.) and disturbance regimes (modeling/policy/management.) 


2. Love, Act Responsibly Towards, Fulfill Duties Towards
including a framework borrowed from biology containing "comensal",
including:
1. Energy, 
2. Nutrients, 
3. Shannon/Turing Information, 
4. Definition behaviors

Q: Why are we talking about ethics (love, duty, and responsibility)? 
A: There is an epidemic of anti-best-practice action and rhetoric. There should be:
1. a system medicine research area;
2. a system epidemiology task-force.


3. Reception And Reflection:
There is a time for reception and reflection.
I will be receptive and reflective for a [period of] time 
for example 3-5 inhalation-exhalation cycles,
(e.g.)
1 meter squared
1 meter diameter
+/ 
Three ~levels/areas of duty / participation-modes: pre-participant, participant, post-participant


4. Misc:
- Range of Motion
- non-transference (non-automatic learning, non-general learning)
- (policies on) errors and mistakes
- vetruvian-egg-shell
- empathy and compassion


Participation Array, 5x5 items: 
(This should be generalizable and specifically applicable given an array of 5x5 items.)
1. Participation Items
2. Setting Location Items
3. Definition Behavior Items
4. Proximity, Scale, Contact, Interaction, Exposure Items 
5. Standard Set of Agreed Upon Goals, Means, Methods Areas

[5x5 array]
Four Areas of Interaction: (e.g. four comparison criteria for each cell in 5x5 array)

1. (Participant Diversity) Love, Duty, Responsibility, Including Boundary Dissolution Areas
Connection, disconnection, and ambiguity, in the following areas:
1.1 time space location
1.2 perception
1.3 action
1.4 experience
1.5 votes on goals means methods


(2&3)
Operational Definition of "Help":
"Deploying features that meet the stated and indicated needs and goals of a user is 'helping.' "

2. Giving Help
3. Receiving Help
Operational Definition of "Help":
'Help' is defined as deploying a feature that meets the stated, and indicated, needs and goals of a user.


4. Drake Equation Vessel Functions: in the following seven areas
Sub-Participants can, should, will, want to, do, help, and / or help with, serve, and / or serve with, setting-location-items in a legal vessel-capacity occupational role and niche and offer legal-vessel-contracts in the following ~seven areas:

4.1  Sensory Motor (Lear: Use My Eyes) Areas (Plus Electromagnetism)
4.2  Benzaiten Saraswati Areas (Plus historical continuity, minus high definition input output data-literacy/numeracy) (Note: translation and transmission)
?4.3  Embodyment / Channeling Items: theater-groups and community interaction, CRV, active-imagination
4.4  Functions and Operations:
4.4.1 Null, Void
4.4.1.1 negative choices and definitions
4.4.1.2 consciousness array: 3 fractal vectors
4.4.1.2.1  time, body
4.4.1.2.2  object location event

4.4.1.2.3.1 behaviors details: 
in / out;  
on / off; 
start / stop; 
begin / end; 
dual / non-dual; 
mundane / non-mundane
4.4.1.2.3.2 Policies details: 
perception, translation, coordination, collaboration, non-discrimination, non-collapse

4.4.3 Something-hard, Something-Soft Areas
4.4.4 (basal) Input-Output Processing Areas
4.4.5 Cross Context Areas

5. Definition Dark Areas / off the one-tree

6. World Dancing, World Singing: the song and dance of compromise

7. Professional Technical Production Advice: six sigma for rivers, grains of sand, ecosystems, keystone species

8. "Help others at all times":

1.  I will do my best to help all parties according to all known best practice standards and protocols; to manage down or manage to equilibrium system-collapse, to manage up or manage to equilibrium system-value-function-and-meaning.

2.  Best Practice Blessing: 
"May you, may we, may noun, 
become proficient 
in the sustainable cultivation 
of value, function, and meaning,
via a local implementation 
of generalized system best practice,
with local spice and sauce."
[~'...with local customs and knowledge.']

3.  Learn from mistakes, your mistakes and the mistakes of others. You are the protector of those who cannot or do not learn from mistakes.



2. Clarification Statements Section: 
Disinformation & System Collapse

("Clarification statements" relate to system defense, system immune-system, diagnostics, disinformation, collapse-metrics, weak-points.
Definition of statement to be as clear and unambiguous as possible: "It is bad, it is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.")

Given enough participants, there will be participants who will push to and past the point of system collapse.

(You need to know that collapse happens.
You need to know where and how collapse happens.
You need to know what collapse looks like.
You need to know how to prepare for, prevent, and recover from collapse.)

Whether or not a statement should be clarified is an important item that should be dealt with according to all known best practice standards and protocols; 
1. No unilateral changes to group-agreed-upon goals, means, and methods, and 
2. No unilateral system collapse.


2.  Two Tautology Areas

(Tautology Area 1)
2.1 Tautology Area 1: Three items which are also categories:

2.1.1  Participation: Participating on the behalf of participants without the participation 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.1.2  Best Practice: Mismanaging general-system-management areas 
It is bad, It is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:
2.1.2.1  Having values
2.1.2.2  Valuing Data
2.1.2.3  Communication Reporting Transparency
2.1.2.4  Testing Auditing Feedback
2.1.2.5  No Unilateral System Collapse
2.1.2.6  Proficiency Standards for Time and Schedules

2.1.3  Causality Models: Concept Check: Scapegoating and Elimination: Identifying any entire part of the world as to be scapegoated and eliminated 
is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

(Tautology Area 2)
2.2 Tautology Area 2: Positive and Negatively Defined Areas ("top and bottom" chart areas)
Identifying system collapse as a goal, not indirectly as in dark lighthouse but directly as in exacerbating system collapse, as part of (defining / in any area of) the standard set of agreed upon goal means method areas, is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it: e.g.

2.2.1  Following worst-possible-options
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.2  Playing nazi-chess
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.3  Mismanaging categories of types of systems
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.4  Mismanaging Cross-Context-Areas: 
e.g.
	- exponential elbows
	- perception abstraction
	- indeterminate incompetence and malice
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.

2.2.5 Mismanaging Standard System Policy Areas:
	is bad, is wrong, it causes system collapse, it should not be done, and I will not do it.
For example:  
1. Mismanaging Split substantiations: for example 
'they are all good' 
'they are all bad' 
'they should be dealt with by cramming them together or splitting them apart"
2. Golden circle asymmetry / inside outside asymmetry, deleterious effects include: 
- causality, 
- schedules,
- contracts.
3. System inversion (is a standard data artifact)
4. Basal distal disjunction (is a proxy(model) for (operationally defined system) 'violence')
5. Negative choices and definitions (do not ignore them)
6. Turning on and off (running) system processes ((for example) comparing policy from Roman Catholicism, South Korea, and Judaeica)
7. Half-dark dichotomies (more on that later)

Active Learning Project-Assignment 10:
Use or create a routine to build and maintain a full "range of motion," 'yoga' for body, mind, and language, etc.

Example:
1. Ethics and Projects: Definition Study Mnemonic
2. Body: Parkinson's Body-Extension Exercises/Yoga
https://github.com/lineality/parkinsons_resources 
3. Language: 般若心経 (link)

Activity: Create and use your own system and use feedback and perception to find and communicate what methods work to maintain fitness. 


Summary Brainstorm 1: concepts of improvement
- naive positivism
- equilibria
- system collapse
- positive and negative definition
- cycles longevity, sequence

Summary Brainstorm 2: STEM
What is the nature of how parts of projects and STEM are (or are not) connected? What are categories of types of systems? How do systems, processes, projects, and definitions fail and collapse? Is there any interface between discussion of ethics, morals, even compassion and mindfulness, and the realm of systems and projects and STEM? What are mistakes? What does it mean to learn or course-correct based on mistakes? Can problem-with-perception be themselves perceived? Can obstacles to learning be overcome by learning about those obstacles? 

Summary Brainstorm 3: Clear & Testable Definitions
- What definitions are not sufficiently clear or testable?
